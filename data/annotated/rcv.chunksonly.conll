The O
European B 
Commission I 
said O
on O
Thursday O
it O
disagreed O
with O
German B 
advice O
to O
consumers O
to O
shun O
British B 
lamb O
until O
scientists O
determine O
whether O
mad O
cow O

can O
be O
transmitted O
to O

. O

Germany B 
's O
representative O
to O
the O
European B 
Union I 
's O
veterinary O
committee O
Werner B 
Zwingmann I 
said O
on O
Wednesday O
consumers O
should O
buy O
sheepmeat O
from O
countries O
other O
than O
Britain B 
until O
the O
scientific O
advice O
was O
clearer O
. O

" O
We O
do O
n't O
support O
any O
such O
recommendation O
because O
we O
do O
n't O
see O
any O
grounds O
for O
it O
, O
" O
the O
Commission B 
's O
chief O
spokesman O
Nikolaus B 
van I 
der I 
Pas I 
told O
a O
news O
briefing O
. O

He O
said O
further O
scientific O
study O
was O
required O
and O
if O
it O
was O
found O
that O
action O
was O
needed O
it O
should O
be O
taken O
by O
the O
European B 
Union I 
. O

He O
said O
a O
proposal O
last O
month O
by O
EU B 
Farm O
Commissioner O
Franz B 
Fischler I 
to O
ban O
sheep O
brains O
, O
spleens O
and O
spinal O
cords O
from O
the O
human O
and O
animal O
food O
chains O
was O
a O
highly O
specific O
and O
precautionary O
move O
to O
protect O
human O
health O
. O

Fischler B 
proposed O
EU-wide B 
measures O
after O
reports O
from O
Britain B 
and O
France B 
that O
under O
laboratory O
conditions O
sheep O
could O
contract O
Bovine B 
Spongiform I 
Encephalopathy I 
( O
BSE B 
) O
-- O
mad O
cow O
disease O
. O

But O
Fischler B 
agreed O
to O
review O
his O
proposal O
after O
the O
EU B 
's O
standing O
veterinary O
committee O
, O
mational O
animal O
health O
officials O
, O
questioned O
if O
such O
action O
was O
justified O
as O
there O
was O
only O
a O
slight O
risk O
to O
human O
health O
. O

Spanish B 
Farm O
Minister O
Loyola B 
de I

had O
earlier O
accused O
Fischler B 
at O
an O
EU B 
farm O
ministers O
' O
meeting O
of O
causing O
unjustified O
alarm O
through O
" O
dangerous O
generalisation O
. O
" O

. O

Only O
France B 
and O
Britain B 
backed O
Fischler B 
's O
proposal O
. O

The O
EU B 
's O
scientific O
veterinary O
and O
multidisciplinary O
committees O
are O
due O
to O
re-examine O
the O
issue O
early O
next O

and O
make O
recommendations O
to O
the O
senior O
veterinary O
officials O
. O

Sheep O
have O
long O
been O
known O
to O
contract O
scrapie O
, O
a O
brain-wasting O
disease O
similar O

BSE B 
which O
is O
believed O
to O
have O
been O
transferred O
to O

animal O

. O

British B 
farmers O
denied O
on O
Thursday O
there O
was O
any O
danger O
to O
human O
health O
from O
their O
sheep O
, O
but O
expressed O
concern O
that O
German B 
government O
advice O
to O
consumers O
to O
avoid O
British B 
lamb O
might O
influence O

illness O

contaminated O
beef O
. O

The O
European B 
Commission I 
agreed O
this O
month O
to O
rethink O
a O
proposal O
to O
ban O
the O
use O
of O
suspect O
sheep O
tissue O
after O
some O
EU B 
veterinary O
experts O
questioned O
whether O
it O

EU B 
Farm O

banning O
sheep O
brains O
, O
spleens O

spinal O

But O
some O

questioned O
whether O
the O
action O
was O
necessary O
given O
the O
slight O

human O
health O

The O
question O
is O
being O
studied O

. O

British B 
officials O
say O
sheep O
meat O
is O
perfectly O
safe O
to O

. O

ZDF B

Germany B

Lauck B

argued O
that O

title O
of O

During O
the O

The O

rejected O

that O
Lauck B

extradition O
from O

where O
he O
was O
arrested O
in O
March O

He O
will O
probably O
be O
free O
in O
around O
two O
and O
a O
half O
years O

The O

ruled O
that O
the O
15 O
months O

has O
spent O
in O
custody O

, O
with O
nothing O

said O
the O
cost O
of O
such O
unimported O
goods O
was O
$ O
1.10 O
billion O
in O
1995 O
. O

Barter O
deals O
were O
worth O
$ O
4.9 O

last O

, O
or O
about O
eight O

all O

at O

, O
she O
said O
. O

" O
The O
cost O
of O
exported O
goods O
is O
too O
often O
understated O
, O
so O
the O

share O
of O

in O

and O
the O
amount O
of O
unimported O

may O
be O
even O
higher O
, O
" O
Volkova B 
said O
. O

A O
few O
days O
ago O
Russian B 
President O
Boris B 
Yeltsin I 
issued O
a O
decree O
on O
state O
regulation O
of O
foreign O
barter O

, O
and O
Volkova B 
said O
this O
" O
could O
substantially O
improve O
the O

" O
. O

In O
line O
with O
the O
decree O
, O
which O
will O
come O
into O
force O
on O
November O
1 O
, O
all O
Russian B

will O
be O
obliged O
to O
import O
goods O
worth O
the O
cost O
of O
their O

180 O
days O
. O

" O
If O

are O
late O
, O
they O
will O
have O
to O
pay O

, O
" O
Volkova B

Understating O
the O

of O

could O
still O
be O
a O
loophole O
for O

, O
but O
Volkova B

the O
authorities O
are O
currently O
" O

Barter O
has O
always O

, O
but O
Yeltsin B 
's O
decrees O
liberalising O
foreign O
trade O
in O
1991-1992 O
has O
given O
barter O
a O
new O
impetus O
. O

A O
few O
years O
ago O
, O
barter O
deals O
accounted O
for O
up O
to O
25-30 O
percent O
of O
Russian B

because O
" O

" O
, O
Volkova B

" O
Now O

Mutola B 
pushed O
Masterkova B 
all O
the O
way O
, O
finishing O
second O
in O
2:29.66 O
. O

But O
it O
was O
the O
Russian B 
who O
picked O
up O
the O
bonus O
of O
$ O
25,000 O
for O
the O
historic O
run O
in O
front O
of O
a O

her O
return O

In O
her O
first O

at O
the O
richest O
meeting O
in O
Zurich B 
last O
Wednesday O
, O
she O
slashed O

. O

The O

50,000 O
plus O
one O
kilo O
of O
gold O
. O

After O
Friday O

the O
Russian B 
will O
have O
earned O
well O
over O
$ O
100,000 O
in O
less O
than O
a O

, O
taking O
her O

Brussels B

laid O
a O
new O

the O

comparable O
to O
the O

at O
the O
Atlanta B

but O
put O
down O
on O
a O
softer O

. O

Masterkova B 
clearly O
enjoyed O
it O
. O

Mutola B 
looked O
threatening O
in O
the O
final O
200 O
metres O
but O
the O
Russian B 
found O
an O
extra O

Many O

apparently O
saw O
their O
crucial O

last O

because O

were O
jammed O
with O
blue-and-white O

To O
be O
sure O
, O
sales O
of O
Windows B

the O
accompanying O

drove O
Microsoft B 
sales O
up O
46 O
percent O
last O
year O
to O
a O
record O
$ O
8.67 O
billion O
and O
cemented O
the O

Microsoft B 
executives O
say O
they O
are O
thrilled O
with O
the O

that O

the O

now O
used O
on O

But O
Enderle B 
said O
the O
figure O
could O
have O
been O
even O
higher O
if O
Microsoft B 
had O
done O
a O
better O
job O

handling O
the O
huge O

He O
and O
other O

said O
corporate O
America B

" O
Microsoft B

that O

going O

the O
answer O
, O
" O
Winkler B

" O

Many O

began O
to O

now O
that O

Winkler B

only O

Up O
to O
100,000 O
tonnes O
of O
copper O
held O
in O
Shanghai B 
bonded O
warehouses O
, O
confounding O
the O
world O
market O
as O
to O
its O
source O
and O
ultimate O
fate O
, O
probably O
belongs O
to O
China B 
's O
strategic O
state O
reserve O
, O
industry O
sources O
said O
on O
Friday O
. O

Around O
40,000 O
tonnes O
of O
the O
copper O
have O
already O
been O
moved O
to O
warehouses O
near O
the O
northern O
port O
of O
Yingkou B 
, O
where O
some O
of O
the O
strategic O
stockpile O
was O
stored O
, O
they O
said O
. O

Just O
who O
owns O
the O
copper O
is O
a O
question O
that O
has O
kept O
traders O
and O
industry O
analysts O
guessing O
since O
the O
metal O
was O
channelled O
into O
Shanghai B 
by O
the O
China B 
National I 
Nonferrous I 
Metals I 
Import I 
and I 
Export I 
Corp I 
( O
CNIEC B 
) O
in O
June O
and O
July O
. O

It O
was O
unclear O
whether O
or O
not O
the O
40,000 O
tonnes O
had O
cleared O
customs O
-- O
which O
would O
provide O
some O
concrete O
indication O
that O
the O
strategic O
reserve O
, O
administered O
directly O
by O
the O
central O
government O
's O
State B 
Planning I 
Commission I 
, O
owned O
the O
copper O
. O

Traders O
have O
said O
the O
reserve O
could O
negotiate O
concessions O
on O
duties O
-- O
three O
percent O
import O
tax O
and O
17 O
percent O
value-added O
tax O
-- O
that O
made O
the O
copper O
prohibitively O
expensive O
otherwise O
. O

But O
one O
source O
, O
the O
head O
of O
a O
Hong B 
Kong I 
trading O
house O
, O
said O
it O
made O
no O
difference O
if O
the O
copper O
was O
customs O
cleared O
or O
not O
. O

" O
If O
they O
spend O
all O
this O
money O
moving O
the O
copper O
to O
Yingkou B 
, O
it O
will O
be O
sitting O
there O
for O
years O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

" O
Once O
it O
arrives O
in O
Yingkou B 
, O
it O
is O
subject O
to O
monitoring O
by O
the O
State B 
Planning I 
Commission I 
, O
which O
has O
to O
give O
permission O
for O
any O
more O
movement O
; O
it O
is O
out O
of O
the O
hands O
of O
traders O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

Mystery O
has O
surrounded O
the O
Shanghai B 
stockpile O
in O
recent O
months O
, O
with O
traders O
unsure O
not O
only O
of O
who O
owns O
it O
, O
but O
of O
its O
exact O
size O
and O
what O
its O
owner O
planned O
to O
do O
with O
it O
. O

Trading O
sources O
generally O
agreed O
it O
would O
be O
cost-effective O
to O
take O
the O
copper O
back O
into O
a O
depleted O
central O
reserve O
as O
it O
had O
already O
served O
its O
purpose O
in O
taking O
advantage O
of O
long-term O
backwardation O
on O
the O
London B 
Metal I 
Exchange I 
( O
LME B 
) O
. O

A O
backwardation O
occurs O
when O
the O
spot O
price O
of O
a O
metal O
is O
higher O
than O
the O
forward O
price O
. O

CNIEC B 
lent O
around O
85,000 O
tonnes O
of O
copper O
onto O
the O
LME B 
between O
April O
and O
June O
1995 O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
state O
reserve O
, O
running O
the O
state O
stockpile O
down O
to O
115,000 O
tonnes O
from O
200,000 O
tonnes O
previously O
. O

Traders O
in O
Asia B 
said O
CNIEC B 
could O
well O
have O
lent O
it O
to O
the O
market O
at O
around O
US$ B 
2,700 O
a O
tonne O
, O
and O
then O
paid O
somewhere O
between O
$ O
2,200 O
and O
$ O
2,400 O
a O
tonne O
when O
it O
started O
taking O
the O
metal O
back O
earlier O
this O
year O
. O

This O
would O
have O
cleared O
CNIEC B 
a O
healthy O
profit O
, O
which O
could O
then O
have O
been O
used O
to O
finance O
storage O
and O
other O
costs O
. O

Word O
that O
CNIEC B 
had O
offered O
the O
copper O
to O
European B 
trading O
houses O
in O
a O
series O
of O
secret O
meetings O
unnerved O
an O
already O
jittery O
market O
. O

on O
Wednesday O
the O
motivation O
of O
the O
owners O
of O
the O
85,000 O
tonnes O
, O
" O

they O
are O
, O
is O
the O
most O
important O
short-term O

" O

BME B 
repeated O
in O

rumours O
of O
involvement O
by O
Sumitomo B

, O
with O
CNIEC B

in O
June O
losses O
of O
$ O
1.8 O
billion O
in O
a O
decade O
of O
unauthorised O

. O

Sumitomo B 
and O
CNIEC B 
have O
made O
no O
comments O
on O
the O
talk O
and O
Chinese B 
traders O
said O
they O
know O
nothing O
of O
such O
an O
arrangement O
. O

Traders O
in O
Shanghai B 
said O
on O
Thursday O
they O
were O
unaware O
of O
movements O
out O
of O
the O
Shanghai B 
bonded O
warehouses O
. O

They O
reported O
more O
arrivals O
that O
were O
probably O
spot O
purchases O
. O

They O
also O
expressed O
concern O
that O
the O
tonnage O
in O
bonded O
warehouses O
would O
move O
onto O
the O
domestic O
market O
. O

But O
these O
concerns O
were O
irrelevant O
, O
a O
Singapore B 
trader O
said O
, O
despite O
a O
forecast O
that O
domestic O
Chinese B 
copper O
demand O
could O
hit O
one O
million O
tonnes O
this O
year O
. O

As O
with O
many O
commodities O
, O
" O
there O
is O
a O
desire O
( O
by O
the O
Chinese B 
government O
) O
to O
keep O
a O
stockpile O
of O
the O
metal O
, O
" O

They O
show O
that O

aware O

building O
cells O
in O
some O
of O
his O

or O
was O

house O
where O
Julie B

to O
just O
take O
the O

Chris B 
Lewis I 
did O
his O
best O
to O
forget O
his O
controversial O
omission O
from O
the O
England B 
one-day O
squad O
on O
Sunday O
but O
could O
not O
prevent O
Pakistan B 
reasserting O
their O
dominance O
in O
the O
final O
test O
at O
The B 
Oval I 
. O

A O
super O
piece O

fielding O
by O
Lewis B 
, O
dropped O
as O
a O
disciplinary O
measure O
after O
arriving O
only O
35 O
minutes O
before O
the O
start O
on O
the O
fourth O
morning O
, O
provided O
the O
only O
bright O
spot O
for O
England B 
as O
the O
touring O
team O
batted O
on O
to O
reach O
413 O
for O
five O
at O
the O
interval O
, O
a O
lead O
of O
87 O
. O

The O
solitary O
wicket O
to O
fall O
was O
Asif B 
Mujtaba I 
, O
run O
out O
for O
13 O
attempting O
a O
second O
run O
to O
third O
man O
where O
Lewis B 
was O
lurking O
with O
a O
point O
to O
prove O
. O

There O
seemed O
scant O
danger O
until O
the O
Surrey B 
player O
swooped O
on O
to O
the O
ball O
and O
returned O
off O
balance O
to O
county O
team O
mate O
Alec B 
Stewart I 
who O
whipped O
off O
the O
bails O

Lewis B 
, O
though O
, O
could O
not O
make O
similar O
waves O
with O
the O
ball O
as O
Salim B 
Malik I 
and O
Wasim B 
Akram I 
batted O
through O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
session O
with O
few O
alarms O

Wasim B 
rattled O
along O
to O
30 O
not O
out O
, O
outscoring O
his O
partner O
who O
was O
unbeaten O
on O
24 O
at O
the O
break O
, O
although O
the O
weather O
was O
again O
threatening O

Rain O
arrived O
just O
as O
the O
players O
left O
the O
field O
for O
lunch O
, O
forcing O
the O
ground-staff O
into O
action O

The O

Zinzan B 
Brooke I 
, O
the O
only O
No O
8 O
in O
test O
rugby O
to O
have O
scored O
a O
dropped O
goal O
when O
he O
kicked O
a O
three-pointer O
against O
England B 
during O
last O
year O
's O
World B 
Cup I 
, O
added O
a O
second O
to O
his O
name O
yesterday O
. O

I O
was O
right O
here O
, O
' O
' O
he O
said O
standing O
at O
the O
spot O
where O
he O
had O
received O
the O
ball O
for O
the O
kick O
. O

The O
maul O
was O
there O
and O
I O
was O
going O
to O
go O
in O
but O
I O
thought O
I O
should O
hold O
off O
because O
we O
had O
the O
ball O
. O

When O
( O
halfback O
) O
Justin B 
Marshall I 
got O
the O
ball O
he O
was O
going O
to O
go O
on O
the O
openside O
where O
Jon B 
Preston I 
was O
so O
I O
emptied O
my O
lung O
at O
him O
to O
get O
the O
ball O
this O
way O
. O

I O
just O
hit O
through O
and O
I O
was O
punching O
the O
air O
before O
the O
ball O
got O
there O
. O

It O
cost O
me O
a O
few O
bucks O
at O
the O
bar O
. O
' O

' O

The O
decision O
to O
attempt O
a O
dropped O
goal O
was O
a O
spontaneous O
one O
, O
Brooke B 
said O
. O

It O
was O
just O
like O
the O
World B 
Cup I 
, O
the O
ball O
came O
and O
the O
chance O
was O
there O
. O

Centre O
Frank B 
Bunce I 
said O
he O
had O
never O
felt O
so O
exhausted O
during O
a O
match O
. O

We O
were O
gutted O
and O
there O
was O
nowhere O
to O
hide O
, O
they O
just O
kept O
coming O
at O
you O
, O
' O
' O
he O
said O
. O

I O
was O
gone O
in O
the O
first O
20 O
minutes O
, O
completely O
exhausted O
, O
but O
you O
had O
no O
choice O
. O

There O
was O
just O
so O
much O
riding O
on O
it O
. O

It O
's O
amazing O
just O
how O
big O
this O
ground O
was O
yesterday O
. O

' O

Two-try O
winger O
Jeff B 
Wilson I 
said O
he O
was O
so O
tired O
that O
he O
kept O
asking O
Bunce B 
where O
he O
should O
be O
while O
defending O
. O

He O
told O
me O
I O
'm O
buggered O
too O
so O
just O
hang O
in O
there O
' O
, O
' O

who O
have O
the O

of O

on O
their O
hands O

Leaders O
of O
the O
major O
parties O

from O

to O

, O
appeared O
before O
Archbishop O

Reconciliation I 
Commission I 
last O

to O
paint O
the O
broad O

of O
their O
actions O

against O

Most O

former O

Klerk I 
and O
African B 
National I 
Congress I 
Deputy O
President O
Thabo B

offered O

mistakes O
they O
had O
made O
and O
accepted O
broad O
responsibility O
for O
the O
actions O
of O
their O

But O
none O

those O
guilty O

or O
carrying O
out O
any O
of O
the O
gross O
violations O
of O
human O
rights O
which O
Tutu B 
is O
investigating O
. O

Human O
rights O
lawyer O
Brian B 
Currin I 
said O
the O
hearings O
last O
week O
were O
not O
intended O
as O
a O
form O
of O
confessional O
and O
that O
those O
who O
personally O
committed O
crimes O
during O
apartheid O
would O
testify O
only O
before O
a O
separate O
arm O
of O
the O
commission O
, O
the O
amnesty O
committee O
. O

" O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
one O
should O
have O
expected O
more O
than O
what O
one O
got O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O
" O

That O
was O
not O
the O
amnesty O
committee O
where O
perpetrators O
are O
expected O
to O
open O
their O
hearts O
and O
souls O
and O
to O
tell O
it O
all O
. O
" O

The O
commission O
, O
which O
has O
the O
power O
to O
grant O
amnesty O
to O
those O
who O
confess O
to O
abuses O
, O
has O
begun O
hearing O
the O
testimony O
from O
people O
already O
in O
jail O
for O
their O
deeds O
. O

But O
others O
, O
such O
as O
self-confessed O
secret O
police O
hit-squad O
leader O
Dirk B 
Coetzee I 
, O
have O
yet O
to O
testify O
. O

Tutu B 
's O
deputy O
chairman O
, O
Alex B 
Boraine I 
, O
told O
reporters O
the O
commission O
would O
begin O
issuing O
subpoenas O
to O
suspects O
who O
refused O
to O
appear O
voluntarily O
some O
time O
this O
week O
. O

He O
added O
that O
former O
hardline O
apartheid O
president O
P.W. B 
Botha I 
could O
be O
among O
those O
called O
. O

But O
Currin B 
, O
who O
is O
advising O
several O
people O
regarded O
as O
perpetrators O
, O
said O
this O
was O
not O
the O
best O
way O
to O
achieve O
the O
commission O
's O
aims O
. O

" O
A O
person O
can O
be O
forced O
to O
appear O
, O
but O
the O
only O
way O
one O
is O
going O
to O
get O
to O
the O
truth O
in O
its O
totality O
is O
if O
people O
feel O
it O
is O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
go O
to O
the O
amnesty O
committee O
. O

At O
the O
moment O
this O
is O
not O
the O
case O
. O
" O

He O
cited O
Coetzee B 
, O
who O
was O
charged O
with O
murder O
after O
confessing O
in O
media O
interviews O
to O
dirty O
tricks O
. O

His O
trial O
is O
due O
to O
start O
in O
December O
but O
the O
truth O
commission O
intends O
to O
decide O
on O
his O
amnesty O
application O
before O
that O
. O

Currin B 
said O
the O
law O
had O
to O
be O
changed O
so O
all O
judicial O
prosecutions O
were O
automatically O
suspended O
for O
those O
who O
approached O
the O
truth O
commission O

Last O

submissions O

ANC B

National B 
Party I 
and O
the O
right-wing O
Freedom B 
Front I 
of O
General O
Constand B 
Viljoen I 
left O
many O
South B 
Africans I 
unsatisfied O
. O

Boraine B 
said O
the O
picture O
was O
incomplete O
because O
officers O
of O
the O
apartheid-era O
security O
forces O
had O
yet O
to O
make O
their O
scheduled O
, O
separate O
submission O
, O
but O
one O
black O
caller O
to O
a O
radio O
talk O
show O
declared O
: O

" O
This O
whole O
thing O
is O
utterly O
useless O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
help O
us O
at O
all O
. O

What O
the O
people O
expect O
is O
to O
have O
houses O
, O
to O
have O
jobs O
. O
" O

Political O
scientist O
Jannie B 
Gagiano I 
said O
he O
doubted O
that O
the O
National B 
Party I 
, O
which O
implemented O
apartheid O
in O
1948 O
and O
began O
dismantling O
it O
in O
1990 O
, O
felt O
it O
carried O
a O
burden O
of O
guilt O
and O
needed O
to O
be O
exculpated O
through O
the O
commission O
. O

" O
Therefore O
I O
have O
some O
doubts O
about O
achieving O
some O
form O
of O
reconciliation O
. O

One O
has O
to O
feel O
a O
bit O
guilty O
to O
feel O
the O
need O
for O
reconciling O
yourself O
to O
a O
historical O
adversary O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

Professor O
Tom B 
Lodge I 
of O
the O
University B 
of I 
the I 
Witwatersrand I 
demurred O
, O
saying O
: O

" O
In O
the O
irritation O
, O
in O
the O
jokes O
, O
in O
the O
anger O
that O
white O
South B 
Africans I 
express O
about O
the O
commission O
, O
I O
think O
there O
's O
a O
moral O
uneasiness O

I O
think O
that O

What O
it O

this O
: O
If O

" O
Happily O
the O

" O

We O

of O

. O

The O
most O
obvious O
one O
with O
the O
greatest O
effect O
on O
the O
corporation O
was O
at O
Impala B 
where O
we O
had O
the O

, O
" O
Gilbertson B

. O

Implats B 
posted O
year O
attributable O
profit O
of O
176 O
million O
rand O
from O
281 O

Not O
only O
did O
the O

lock O
in O

in O
February O
/ O
March O
, O
but O
it O
suffered O

due O
to O
a O

last O
August O
. O

The O
rand O
was O
last O

at O

against O

Nor O
was O
Implats B 
the O
only O
operation O
to O

. O

Ingwe B 
Coal I

It O

one O

at O

in O
Mpumulanga B 
province O
. O

But O
Gilbertson B 
said O
the O
greatest O
gloom O
in O
the O
year O
came O
from O
the O
European B 
Commission I 
's O
blocking O
of O
Implats B 
' O
proposed O

with O
Lonrho B

's O

. O

" O
The O
big O
disappointment O
for O
the O
year O
was O
the O
failure O
of O
the O
platinum O
merger O
. O

From O
Gencor B 
's O
perspective O
we O
are O
taking O
the O
position O
that O
it O
is O
not O
on O
, O
" O
Gilbertson B 
said O
. O

Looking O
ahead O
to O
the O
current O
financial O
year O
, O
he O
said O
that O
Gencor B 
would O
boost O
earnings O
further O
. O

" O
Gencor B 
is O
well O
placed O
to O
take O
up O
the O
challenges O
of O
the O
future O
. O

The O
group O
is O
soundly O
structured O
and O
prudently O
financed O
and O
is O
blessed O
with O
an O
excellent O
portfolio O
of O
world-class O
businesses O
. O

I O
think O
we O
can O
look O
forward O
to O
further O
growth O
" O
. O

Citing O
the O

of O
Gencor B

Malbak B 
Ltd I 
for O
one O

, O
Gilbertson B 
said O
Gencor B 
had O
pruned O
its O
portfolio O
to O
concentrate O
on O
core O
assets O
. O

" O
We O
've O
tried O
to O
clean O
up O
our O
overall O
portfolio O
by O
disposing O
of O
non-core O
assets O
. O

The O
biggest O
of O
those O
was O
Malbak B

Overall O
a O
very O
substantial O
pruning O

leaving O
Gencor B 
clearly O
structured O
along O

lines O
, O
" O
Gilbertson B 
said O
. O

He O
added O
that O
the O
group O
still O
had O
about O
85 O
million O
rand O
after O
tax O
invested O
in O
various O
shares O
, O
which O
were O
market O
for O

when O
required O
. O

Referring O
to O
Gencor B 
's O
increased O
41.5 O
percent O
stake O
in O
Ingwe B 
, O
Gilbertson B 
said O
the O
group O
would O
wait O
for O
coal O
shares O
to O
be O
cheaper O
before O
considering O
snapping O
up O
more O
. O

" O
I O
think O
we O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
have O
more O
of O
Ingwe B 
but O
it O
's O
the O
question O
of O
adding O
value O
. O

When O
we O
bought O
the O
shares O
we O
bought O
... O

at O
quite O
a O
bit O
lower O
than O
the O
price O
is O
now O
... O

maybe O
if O
we O
just O
wait O
another O
few O
years O
for O
the O
next O
downturn O
in O
coal O
. O
" O

Finally O
, O
Gilbertson B

a O

The O
tiny O
islands O
of O
the O
Seychelles B 
failed O
to O
make O
soccer O
history O
at O
the O
weekend O
when O
they O
bowed O
out O

the O
preliminary O

of O
the O
African B 
Nations I

The O
Seychelles B 
must O
have O
thought O
they O

on O

for O
a O
historic O
breakthrough O
when O
Mauritian B 
midfielder O
Andre B 
Caboche I

sent O
off O
for O
a O
crude O
tackle O
in O
the O

immediately O
-- O

Ashley B 
Mocude I

give O
them O
a O
two-goal O
aggregate O

. O

Although O
Danny B 
Rose I

gave O
the O
Seychellois B

hope O
they O
could O
not O

net O
again O
and O

said O
he O
felt O
the O
players O
ought O
to O
have O
organised O
an O
active O
protest O
. O

" O
I O
feel O
that O
we O
made O
it O
a O
little O
easy O
for O
the O
USTA B 
. O

They O
did O
n't O
really O
get O
hurt O
as O
much O
as O
I O
think O
they O
should O
have O
, O
" O
said O
Stich B 
. O
" O

I O
feel O
that O
we O
should O
have O
maybe O
just O
cancelled O
out O
the O
Monday O
, O
not O
show O
up O
today O
and O
start O
the O
tournament O
tomorrow O
. O
" O

But O
once O
the O
27-year-old O
Stich B 
got O
on O
the O
court O
, O
he O
focused O
his O
energies O
on O
trying O
to O
win O
the O
year O
's O
last O
Grand B 
Slam I 
. O

He O
took O
a O
positive O
first O
step O
with O
his O
6-3 O
1-6 O
6-1 O
7-5 O
win O
over O
compatriot O
Haas B 
on O
a O
sun-baked O
Grandstand B 
court O
. O

Others O
advancing O
early O
on O
Monday O
included O
11th-seeded O
American B 
Malivai I 
Washington I 
, O
the O
Wimbledon B 
runner-up O
, O
Sweden B 
's O
Magnus B 
Gustafsson I 
, O
and O
two-time O
former O
French B 
Open I 
champion O
Sergi B 
Bruguera I 
of O
Spain B 
, O
who O
will O
be O
Stich B 
's O
next O
opponent O
. O

The O
suspicion O
, O
however O
, O
lingers O
in O
Stich B 
's O
mind O
that O
U.S. B 
Open I 
officials O
did O
tamper O
with O
the O
seeding O
process O
in O
order O
to O
benefit O
homegrown O
players O
. O

" O
I O
get O
the O
feeling O
that O
everything O
is O
done O
here O
for O
the O
American B 
players O
and O
they O
forget O
about O
all O
the O
other O
players O
, O
" O
said O
Stich B 
, O
who O
lost O
the O
1994 O
Open B 
final O
to O
Andre B 
Agassi I 
. O

It O
was O
Agassi B 
who O
was O
at O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
controversy O
that O
engulfed O
the O
tournament O
since O
the O
original O
draw O
was O
completed O
on O
Wednesday O
. O

The O
flamboyant O
American B 
star O
was O
bumped O
up O
two O
spots O
from O
his O
ATP B 
ranking O
of O
eight O
to O
a O
seeding O
of O
six O
. O

" O
He O
( O
Agassi B 
) O
should O
be O
seeded O
the O
way O
he O
is O
playing O
tennis O
right O
now O
, O
" O
said O
Stich B 
about O
the O
unfairness O
of O
moving O
up O
Agassi B 
, O
who O
made O
early O
exits O
from O
the O
French B 
Open I 
and O
Wimbledon B 
. O

Stich B 
, O
not O
seeded O
here O
for O
the O
first O
time O
since O
1990 O
, O
might O
have O
benefitted O
from O
some O
fiddling O
with O
the O
seedings O
himself O
after O
Kafelnikov B 
withdrew O
. O

Ranked O
18th O
in O
the O
world O
, O
Stich B 
might O
have O
been O
slipped O
into O
that O
spot O
ahead O
of O
Spain B 
's O
Felix B 
Mantilla I 
, O
who O
is O
16th O
but O
had O
never O
been O
played O
in O
the O
Open B 
and O
had O
been O
left O
out O
of O
the O
seedings O
originally O
. O

But O
Stich B 
did O
n't O
want O
to O
play O
that O
game O
. O

" O
I O
think O
he O
deserves O
to O
be O
seeded O
as O
everybody O
else O
who O
is O
in O
the O
top O
16 O
deserves O
to O
be O
seeded O
, O

may O
finally O
get O
to O
discuss O
his O
Chechen B 
peace O
proposals O

Boris B 
Yeltsin I

was O
forced O
to O
abandon O
plans O
to O
sign O
a O

It O
could O

sobering O
experience O
for O

chief O
who O
, O
just O
two O
months O

appointed O
by O
the O
president O
and O
two O
heady O
weeks O
after O
taking O

, O
had O
promised O
to O
wrap O
up O
the O
20-month O
war O
by O
the O
weekend O
. O

Despite O
a O
mood O
of O
compromise O
in O
the O
region O
after O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
fighting O
of O
the O
war O
, O
Lebed B 
may O
be O
just O
finding O
out O
that O
concluding O
a O
long-term O
settlement O
, O
somewhere O
between O
rebel O
demands O
for O
independence O
and O
Moscow B 
's O
insistence O
that O
Chechnya B 
remain O
part O
of O
Russia B 
, O
will O
be O
no O
easy O
matter O
. O

A O
chain-smoking O
former O
paratroop O
general O
with O
a O
sharp O
line O
in O
deadpan O
putdowns O
and O
a O
soldier O
's O
knack O
for O
making O
life O
sound O
simple O
, O
Lebed B 
managed O
to O
arrange O
an O
ambitious O
ceasefire O
in O
the O
region O
last O
week O
, O
days O
after O
the O
Russian B 
army O
threatened O
to O
bomb O
its O
way O
back O
into O
the O
rebel-held O
Chechen B 
capital O
Grozny B 
. O

He O
returned O
at O
the O
weekend O
, O
pledging O
to O
conclude O
a O
political O
settlement O
that O
would O
make O
this O
truce O
work O
where O
all O
others O
have O
failed O
. O

But O
then O
he O
apparently O
thought O
better O
of O
it O
. O

Saying O
he O
needed O
to O
tidy O
up O
legal O
loose O
ends O
on O
the O
deal O
-- O
and O
also O
cover O
his O
back O
against O
unnamed O
pro-war O
schemers O
in O
Moscow B 
-- O
he O
flew O
back O
to O
the O
capital O
empty-handed O
on O
Sunday O
. O

He O
met O
Russian B 
Prime O
Minister O
Viktor B 
Chernomyrdin I 
on O
Monday O
and O
, O
according O
to O
the O
press O
service O
of O
Lebed B 
's O
Security B 
Council I 
, O
could O
meet O
Yeltsin B 
on O
Tuesday O
. O

It O
was O
not O
clear O
if O
the O
start O
of O
Yeltsin B 
's O
holiday O
, O
announced O
later O
, O
would O
affect O
plans O
to O
talk O
. O

Moscow B 
's O
as O
yet O
undisclosed O
proposals O
on O
Chechnya B 
's O
political O
future O
have O
, O
meanwhile O
, O
been O
sent O
back O
to O
do O
the O
rounds O
of O
various O
government O
departments O
. O

It O
is O
not O
known O
what O
caused O
the O
delay O
in O
the O
peace O
plan O
. O

Speculation O
mounted O
last O
week O
that O
Lebed B 
was O
operating O
out O
on O
a O
limb O
in O
Chechnya B 
as O
Yeltsin B 
, O
hardly O
seen O
since O
his O
reelection O
last O
month O
, O
kept O
out O
of O
sight O
and O
then O
gave O
an O
interview O
criticising O
his O
envoy O
just O
as O
he O
clinched O
a O
truce O
. O

But O
Chernomyrdin B 
took O
pains O
at O
the O
weekend O
to O
insist O
Lebed B 
was O
playing O
for O
a O
united O
team O
and O
that O
the O
proposals O
he O
took O
to O
rebel O
chief-of-staff O
Aslan B 
Maskhadov I 
had O
been O
agreed O
by O
Yeltsin B 
. O

If O
that O
were O
the O
case O
, O
it O
was O
unclear O
why O
Lebed B 
suddenly O
found O
it O
necessary O
to O
have O
the O
deal O
verified O
in O
Moscow B 
. O

Lebed B 
himself O
said O
he O
was O
concerned O
that O
powerful O
interests O
in O
Moscow B 
, O
who O
have O
profited O
from O
the O
war O
and O
want O
it O
to O
go O
on O
, O
would O
seize O
on O
any O
inadequacy O
in O
the O
deal O
to O
remove O
him O
. O

Maskhadov B 
warned O
that O
Lebed B 
risked O
the O
same O
fate O
as O
a O
former O
Russian B 
army O
commander O
in O
the O
region O
who O
sought O
a O
compromise O
and O
was O
blown O
up O
last O
year O
by O
-- O
so O
the O
Chechens B 
say O
-- O
Russian B 
forces O
. O

Maskhadov B 
may O
also O
have O
made O
new O
demands O
on O
Lebed B 
, O
forcing O
him O
to O
check O
back O
with O
the O
Kremlin B 
on O
what O
he O
could O
offer O
. O

A O
rebel O
spokesman O
said O
the O
two O
military O
men O
had O
come O
close O
to O
agreement O
on O
a O
face-saving O
formula O
acceptable O
to O
both O
sides O
and O
involving O
a O
referendum O
on O
independence O
at O
some O
future O
date O
. O

Chernomyrdin B 
said O
voters O
should O
decide O
Chechnya B 
's O
future O
but O
stressed O
there O
was O
no O
question O
of O
the O
government O
letting O
the O
region O
quit O
the O
Russian B 
Federation I 
-- O
something O
Moscow B 
fears O
could O
encourage O
separatist O
tendencies O
in O
other O
ethnic O
regions O
, O
particularly O
in O
the O
strategic O
North B 
Caucasus I 
. O

Lebed B 
may O
be O
be O
finding O
that O
closing O
that O
political O
gap O
between O
the O
two O
sides O
is O
more O
difficult O
than O
just O
ending O
a O

Costain B

contract O
to O
build O
the O
controversial O
Newbury B 
bypass O
, O
which O
runs O
through O
a O
conservation O
area O
, O
has O
led O
to O
violent O
protests O
delaying O

and O
picketing O
of O
chief O
executive O
Alan B

home O
. O

A O
Costain B 
spokesman O
told O
Reuters B 
: O
" O
We O
've O
had O
all O
sorts O
of O
protests O
at O
the O
head O
office O
and O
the O
chief O
executive O
's O
house O
. O

But O
it O
's O
when O
it O
gets O
to O
the O
( O
employee O
) O
families O
-- O
that O
it O
goes O
across O
the O
line O
. O
" O

Tactics O
used O
by O
some O
underground O
groups O
including O
the O
cryptic O
Berkshire B 
Wood I 
Elves I 
, O
which O
distribute O
leaflets O
with O
instructions O
on O
home-made O
explosives O
, O
are O
now O
the O
subject O
of O
a O
police O
investigation O
. O

Other O
larger O
activist O
groups O
include O
Earth B 
First I 
, O
The B 
Land I 
is I 
Ours I 
, O
Alarm B 
UK I 
and O
Road B 
Alert I 
. O

The O
groups O
have O
targeted O
specific O
projects O
like O
the O
Newbury B 
bypass O
and O
the O
M3 B 
motorway O
through O
Twyford B 
Down I 
in O
the O
southern O
county O
of O
Hampshire B 
. O

But O
they O
are O
also O
campaigning O
on O
broader O
issue O
such O
as O
stopping O
the O
government O
road O
building O
programme O
and O
out-of-town O
superstores O
which O
they O
say O
create O
more O
traffic O
, O
pollution O
and O
damage O
local O
communities O
. O

The O
government O
has O
slashed O
its O
road-building O
spending O
. O

Although O
protests O
may O
have O
contributed O
to O
the O
decision O
it O
has O
been O
seen O
primarily O
as O
economic O
rather O
than O
ecological O
. O

Graham B 
Watts I 
, O
chief O
executive O
of O
the O
Construction B 
Industry I 
Council I 
, O
said O
: O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
many O
firms O
involved O
in O
tendering O
for O
sensitive O
projects O
realise O
the O
impact O
environmental O
activity O
has O
on O
the O
cost O
of O
running O
a O
project O
. O

" O
But O
they O
are O
more O
alert O
than O
they O
were O
3-4 O
years O
ago O
. O

There O
's O
no O
doubt O
it O
's O
a O
big O
issue O
now O
. O
" O

He O
says O
the O
damage O
comes O
in O
two O
forms O
: O
" O
Tangible O
-- O
in O
the O
form O
of O
extra O
costs O
, O
additional O
security O
, O
threats O
to O
staff O
and O
the O
more O
intangible O
damage O
caused O
by O
negative O
publicity O
. O
" O

Watts B 
said O
the O
cost O
of O
protesting O
can O
be O
heavy O
once O
the O
company O
is O
locked O
into O
a O
contract O
. O

" O
I O
do O
often O
hear O
on O
the O
industry O
circuit O
of O
tales O
where O
the O
company O
tenders O
at O
low O
margins O
and O
the O
demonstrations O
which O
follow O
means O
they O
are O
running O
the O
project O
at O
a O
loss O
. O
" O

ARC B 
says O
it O
's O
not O
just O
contractors O
in O
the O
front O
line O
but O
also O
suppliers O
like O
itself O
. O

Its O
own O
quarries O
came O
under O
attack O
after O
it O
emerged O
that O
it O
may O
be O
a O
supplier O
for O
the O
Newbury B 
bypass O
. O

" O
It O
was O
called O
the O
" O

Battle I 
of I 
the I 
Newbury I

' O
, O
" O
said O
ARC B

" O
We O
had O
300 O

invade O

. O

Hundreds O
of O
thousands O

" O

Simon B 
Brown I 
, O
analyst O
at O
investement O
bank O
UBS B 
, O
said O
this O
new O
phenomenon O
has O
led O
to O
a O
change O
in O
the O
way O
the O
industry O
evaluates O
project O
risk O
. O

" O
When O
talking O
to O
Tarmac B 
about O
the O
M3 B 
link O
( O
through O
Twyford B 
Down I 
) O
they O
made O
it O
fairly O
clear O
that O
their O
risk O
assessment O
methods O
have O
been O
changed O
and O
now O
involve O
a O
very O
clear O
environmental O
risk O
analysis O
. O
" O

Harding B 
says O
others O
have O
done O
the O
same O
. O
" O

As O
a O
result O
of O
eco-terrorism O
we O
are O
looking O
at O
controversial O
jobs O
more O
closely O
to O
see O
if O
the O
profit O
margins O
are O
wide O
enough O
to O
cover O
things O

" O

For O
an O
industry O
already O
suffering O
from O
razor-thin O
margins O
, O
overcapacity O
and O

eco-terrorism O

24 O
double O

The O
most O
deflating O

force O
a O
fifth O
set O
, O
leading O
6-4 O
in O
the O

The O
set O
point O

" O
Those O

" O

who O
promptly O
fired O
two O
serves O
barely O
contained O
by O
the O
baseline O
as O
he O
frittered O
away O
his O
best O
chance O
. O

Chang B 
ran O
off O
the O
next O
three O
points O
to O
close O
out O
the O
match O
but O
for O
Oncins B 
, O
the O
contest O
was O
a O
personal O

Both O
will O

, O
the O

Despite O
the O
current O
difficulties O
, O
however O
, O
analysts O
were O
convinced O
that O
Cofinec B

outlook O
was O
strong O

" O
The O
eastern O

good O

" O

" O

" O

" O
At O
the O

time O
, O
it O

an O

better O

" O
Erdei B 
added O
. O

" O
Cofinec B 
is O
a O
very O
good O
story O
in O
the O
long-term O
as O
the O
per O

consumption O
is O
still O
so O
low O
in O

that O
a O
very O
strong O

) O
, O
" O
Sitanyi B 
said O
, O
saying O
that O
several O
recent O
moves O
by O
Cofinec B 
boosted O
its O
position O
. O

Among O
them O
, O
he O
noted O
that O

company O
Krpaco B 
a.s. I

Ambassador O
Robert B 
Frowick I 
, O
representing O
the O
Organisation B 
for I 
Security I 
and I 
Cooperation I 
in I 
Europe I 
( O
OSCE B

, O
told O

that O
municipal O

due O
on O
September O
14 O
with O
other O
Bosnian B 
elections O
would O
be O
put O
off O
. O

" O
I O
have O
made O
a O
chairman O
's O
decision O
that O
it O
is O
not O
feasible O
to O
hold O
municipal O
elections O
on O
September O
14 O
, O
" O
said O
Frowick B 
. O

He O
said O
no O
exact O
date O
had O
been O
set O
but O
it O
was O
possible O
the O
local O
elections O
would O
take O
place O
in O
the O
spring O
of O
1997 O
. O

According O
to O
OSCE B 
officials O
, O
Serb B 
authorities O
have O
pressed O
their O
refugees O
to O
register O
to O
vote O
in O
towns O
now O
under O
Serb B 
control O
, O
but O
which O
used O
to O
have O
Moslem B 
majorities O
. O

Human O
rights O
workers O
say O
authorities O
in O
Serbia B 
and O
Bosnian B 
Serb I 
territory O
have O
conducted O
a O
well-organised O
campaign O
to O
coerce O
refugees O
into O
registering O
only O
on O
Serb B 
territory O
and O
failed O
to O
inform O
them O
of O
their O
rights O
under O
the O
Dayton B 
peace O
agreement O
. O

Diplomats O
say O
the O
effect O
of O
the O
electoral O
engineering O
would O
be O
to O
establish O
political O
control O
over O
districts O
they O
conquered O

ethnically O
cleansed O
in O

The O
response O
of O
the O
Bosnian B 
Serbs I 
to O
the O
OSCE B 
's O
announcement O
was O
not O
immediately O
clear O
. O

But O
Bosnian B 
Serb I 
leaders O
have O
hinted O
they O
would O
boycott O
the O
poll O
if O
the O
municipal O
elections O
were O
postponed O
, O
or O
go O
ahead O
with O
their O
own O
. O

The O
Bosnian B 
Serb I 
cabinet O
, O
in O
a O
letter O
to O
the O
OSCE B 
, O
said O
on O
Monday O
that O
any O
delay O
of O
local O
elections O
would O
be O
" O
a O
direct O
and O
flagrant O
violation O
fo O
the O
Dayton B 
agreement O
" O
. O

The O
Serbs B 
, O
who O
administer O
half O
of O
Bosnia B 
in O
a O
Serb B 
republic O
, O
said O
they O
had O
met O
all O

for O
holding O
the O

. O

Diplomats O
fear O
that O
the O

over O
the O
entire O
election O
process O
, O
which O
already O

Yeltsin B 
, O
65 O
, O
has O
kept O
a O
low O
profile O
since O
he O
was O
reelected O

speculation O
that O
the O
two O
heart O
attacks O
he O
suffered O
last O
year O

a O
rumoured O
drinking O

could O
be O
taking O
their O
toll O
, O
weakening O
his O
grip O
on O

that O

simply O
needs O
a O
rest O
after O
his O
energetic O

the O
Kremlin B

started O
Russia B

merely O
be O
reluctant O
to O
put O
his O
name O
to O
a O
peace O

which O
might O
fall O
apart O

But O
Lebed B

no O

without O
his O
boss O

has O
hinted O
at O
dark O
forces O

, O
appears O
to O

strong O

from O
Yeltsin B

His O
proposals O

not O

are O
expected O
to O
involve O
a O
compromise O
between O

only O
45 O

put O
down O
as O
a O

This O

WASHINGTON B 
1996-08-28 O

The O
Securities B 
and I 
Exchange I 
Commission I 
Wednesday O
approved O
rules O
designed O
to O
give O
stock O
market O
investors O
a O
better O
chance O
at O
getting O
the O
best O
price O
available O
for O
their O
orders O
. O

The O
so-called O
order O
handling O
rules O
, O
which O
were O
proposed O
last O
September O
, O
were O
approved O
in O
a O
4-0 O
vote O
. O

The O
new O
rules O
will O
require O
specialists O
at O
stock O
exchanges O
and O
market O
makers O
on O
Nasdaq B 
to O
allow O
customers O
to O
view O
price O
quotes O
from O
other O
electronic O
trading O
systems O
that O
may O
not O
be O
readily O
available O
to O
them O
. O

The O
rules O
will O
also O
require O
that O
customer O
limit O
orders O
be O
displayed O
with O
prices O
better O
than O
those O
available O
in O
quotes O
publicly O
available O
at O
the O
time O
. O

Specialists O
and O
market O
makers O
are O
companies O
or O
individuals O
recognised O
as O
qualified O
to O
maintain O
an O
orderly O
market O
in O
a O
stock O
. O

In O
a O
limit O
order O
, O
investors O
specify O
the O
price O
at O
which O
they O
are O
willing O
to O
buy O
or O
sell O
, O
as O
opposed O
to O
a O
market O
order O
executed O
at O
prevailing O
prices O
. O

" O
These O
rules O
are O
intended O
to O
empower O
all O
investors O
, O
by O
allowing O
their O
orders O
to O
compete O
on O
a O
level O
playing O
field O
, O
and O
by O
providing O
the O
disclosure O
they O
need O
to O
make O
informed O
decisions O
, O
" O
said O
SEC B 
Chairman O
Arthur B 
Levitt I 
. O

The O
SEC B 
's O
goal O
, O
he O
added O
, O
was O
to O
create O
" O
one O
system O
where O
one O
price O
could O
be O
available O
to O
everybody O
. O
" O

The O

Richard B

about O
$ O
7 O
million O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
improvements O
called O
for O
by O
the O
new O
rules O
. O

In O
proposing O
the O
rules O
last O
year O
, O
the O
SEC B 
noted O
that O
while O
technology O
has O
improved O
, O
commonplace O
practices O
still O
existed O
that O
worked O
against O
investors O
' O
best O
interests O
. O

It O
noted O
that O
customers O
whose O
orders O
were O
not O
displayed O
lost O
the O
chance O
of O
getting O
the O
best O
possible O
price O
available O
in O
the O
market O
. O

It O
also O
cited O
the O
potential O
problem O
of O
a O
two-tiered O
market O
in O
which O
market O
makers O
quote O
one O
price O
to O
public O
investors O
while O
quoting O
better O
prices O
in O
private O
systems O
, O
thus O
robbing O
investors O
without O
access O
to O
" O
hidden O
" O
quotes O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O
best O
available O
prices O
. O

Earlier O
this O
month O

the O
SEC B 
settled O
charges O
of O
alleged O
malpractices O
on O

the O
parent O
of O

, O
the O

spend O
$ O
100 O

over O
five O
years O
to O
upgrade O
its O
oversight O
of O

The O
SEC B 
dropped O
a O
third O
proposal O
that O
would O
have O
allowed O
investors O
with O
market O
orders O
to O
trade O
at O
a O
better O
price O
if O
there O
were O
shifts O
in O

executed O
. O

The O

said O

two O

" O

makers O
who O
trade O
more O

stock O
during O
any O
quarter O
on O
Nasdaq B 
. O

The O
SEC B

will O
mean O
a O

it O

" O
I O
'm O
not O
here O
to O

press O
or O
talk O
about O
the O
food O
or O
entertain O

I O
have O
much O
more O
fun O
on O

court O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

Just O
three O
years O
ago O
Medvedev B 
was O
one O
of O
the O
world O
's O
best O
, O
with O
a O
ranking O
of O
six O
after O
reaching O
the O
French B 
Open I 
semifinal O
and O
winning O
three O
tournaments O
. O

But O
Medvedev B 
's O
ranking O
slowly O
began O
to O
drop O
last O
year O
as O
he O
struggled O
with O
a O
wrist O
injury O
. O

The O
Ukrainian B 
finally O
hit O
a O
low O
of O
44th O
two O
months O
ago O
. O

" O
It O
's O
somewhere O
where O
I O
would O
n't O
like O
to O
stay O
very O
long O
, O
" O
Medvedev B 
said O
of O
his O
current O
ranking O
of O
36 O
. O
" O

It O
's O
a O
part O
of O
the O
penalty O
that O
I O
have O
to O
accept O
. O
" O

As O
part O
of O
his O
new O
businesslike O
approach O
, O
Medvedev B 
hired O
Australian B 
coach O
Bob B 
Brett I 
at O
the O
start O
of O
this O
year O
and O
the O
partnership O
is O
beginning O
to O
pay O
off O
. O

" O
At O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
year O
we O
started O
from O
zero O
, O
" O
said O
Medvedev B 
. O
" O

Winning O
in O
Long B 
Island I 
( O
last O
week O
) O
was O
like O
winning O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O
" O

While O
Medvedev B 
's O
77-minute O
romp O
past O
Fleurian B 
was O
rather O
ordinary O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
two O
were O
playing O
each O
other O
was O
rather O
remarkable O
. O

In O
the O
original O
draw O
, O
Medvedev B 
and O
Fleurian B 
were O
slotted O
to O
play O
each O
other O
. O

When O
controversy O
forced O
the O
draw O
to O
be O
done O
over O
-- O
against O
odds O
of O
151-to-1 O
-- O
Medvedev B 
and O
Fleurian B 
drew O
each O
other O
a O
second O
time O
. O

" O
When O
I O
saw O
the O
new O
draw O
I O
did O
n't O
have O
to O
change O
my O
preparation O
, O
" O
Medvedev B 
said O
. O
" O

I O
think O
it O
's O
destined O
that O
it O
turned O
out O
for O
me O

. O

Smicer B 
pushed O
the O

home O
in O
injury O
time O
to O
lead O
his O

to O
a O

Foe I 
equalised O
on O
a O

in O
the O

the O
fourth O
in O
as O

for O
Lens B 
, O
who O
lead O

Along O
with O
Smicer B 
, O
Robert B 
Pires I 
was O
the O
star O
of O
the O
night O
in O
France B 
, O
scoring O
the O
first O
hat-trick O
of O
the O
league O
season O
in O
Metz B

3-1 O

Pires B 
, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
promising O
strikers O
in O
the O
country O
, O
was O
called O
up O
for O
the O
first O
time O
this O
week O
by O
French B 
manager O
Aime B 
Jacquet I 
for O
a O
friendly O
against O
Mexico B 
on O
Saturday O
at O
the O
Parc B

Pires B 
scored O
first O

a O
powerful O
shot O
in O
the O
35th O
minute O
before O
striking O
again O
from O
close O
range O
just O
before O
the O
break O
. O

A O
solitary O
raid O
allowed O
him O
to O
score O
his O
third O
in O
the O
74th O
. O

Smicer B 
's O
goal O
was O
as O
hard-won O
as O
his O
team O
's O
victory O
. O

Spurred O
by O
Foe B 
's O
leveller O
five O
minutes O
before O
, O
Lens B 
pressed O
hard O
and O
Foe B 
hit O
the O
crossbar O
in O
the O
dying O
seconds O
on O
another O
header O
. O

The O
ball O
bounced O
back O
to O
Smicer B

feet O
and O
he O
scored O
. O

Montpellier B 
seized O
an O
unexpected O
lead O
thanks O
to O
Kader B 
Ferhaoui I 
in O
the O
fourth O
minute O
after O
a O
blunder O
from O
Lens B 
goalkeeper O
Jean-Claude B 
Nadon I 
. O

The O
side O
from O
northern O
France B 
, O
forced O
to O
fight O
an O
uphill O
battle O
from O
then O
on O
, O
pulled O
level O
thanks O
to O
Tony B 
Vairelles I 
in O
the O
eighth O
minute O
but O
young O
striker O
Fabien B 
Lefevre I 
made O
it O
two O

Montpellier B 
five O
minutes O
later O
. O

League O
favourites O
PSG B 
scored O
a O
convincing O
1-0 O
win O
over O
Nantes B 
and O
confirmed O
they O
would O
again O
be O
the O
team O
to O
beat O
this O
season O
. O

Ironically O
, O
PSG B 
's O
victory O
owed O
a O
lot O
to O
two O
former O
Nantes B 
players O
, O
striker O
Patrice B 
Loko I 
, O
who O
scored O
on O
a O
brilliant O
shot O
in O
the O
33rd O

and O
defender O
Benoit B 
Cauet I 
, O
who O
started O
the O
one-two O
which O
allowed O
Loko B 
to O
score O
. O

The O
Parisians B 
, O
who O
have O
yet O
to O
concede O
a O
goal O
, O
were O
without O
Brazil B

Julio B 
Cesar I 
Dely I 
Valdes I 
, O
both O
called O

For O
Nantes B 
, O
who O
shocked O
PSG B 
to O
win O
the O
league O
crown O
two O
years O

, O
the O
fall O
is O
very O

The B 
Canaries I

who O
lost O
most O
of O

within O
two O
years O
, O
have O
yet O

Rosati B

Russia B

Yeltsin B

a O

Dole B

questions O
about O
whether O

a O

" O

I O
did O

anything O

I O
was O
talking O
about O

I O
said O
you O

That O

all O
I O
said O

When O

if O
he O

Dole B

: O
" O
Oh O

Come O

you O

" O

Dole B 
campaign O
aides O
said O
the O
candidate O
was O
telling O
young O
people O
not O
to O
smoke O
. O

Dole B 
also O
said O
he O
opposed O
California B 
Proposition I 
215 I 
which O
, O
if O
approved O
by O
voters O
, O
would O
allow O
the O
cultivation O
of O
marijuana O
plants O
for O
medicinal O
uses O
. O

Dole B 
said O
the O
initiative O
would O
allow O
marijuana O
to O
be O
used O
for O
anything O
from O
a O
headache O
to O
an O
ingrown O
toenail O
. O

In O
an O
effort O
to O
paint O
the O
drug O
issue O
in O
non-political O
terms O
, O
Dole B 
said O
three O
times O
during O
his O
20-minute O
address O
that O
illegal O
drug O
use O
was O
neither O
a O
Democratic B 
nor O
a O
Republican B 
issue O
but O
one O
that O
involves O
all O
people O
. O

The O
anti-drug O
message O
is O
a O
theme O
Dole B 
feels O
has O
strong O
voter O
appeal O
. O

On O
Sunday O
near O
Chicago B 
he O
accused O
President O
Bill B 
Clinton I 
of O
" O
raising O
the O
white O
flag O
" O
in O
the O
war O
on O
drugs O
. O

A O
recent O
survey O
showed O
that O
illegal O
drug O
use O
among O
12-17 O
year-olds O
had O
doubled O
in O
the O
past O
four O
years O
. O

Dole B 
was O
flanked O
by O
several O
California B 
Republican I 
politicians O
including O
Gov O
. O

Pete B 
Wilson I 
, O
who O
said O
local O

cannot O
fight O
illegal O

alone O
. O

" O

From O

Terence B

Ambassador O

He O

Washington B 
strongly O
supported O
the O

imposed O
already O
and O
if O
these O
did O
not O

the O

would O
consider O
" O
an O

" O

But O
he O
said O
the O

to O
be O

and O
avoid O
a O

" O

saying O
Britain B

cow O

would O
die O
out O
by O

offered O
little O
prospect O
the O

would O
change O
an O

" O
Obviously O
we O
are O
interested O
in O
this O
research O
. O

We O
will O
ask O
the O
( O
EU B 
) O
scientific O
and O
veterinary O
committee O
to O
examine O
it O
, O
" O
Commission B

Gerard B

But O
he O
added O
that O
new O
research O
into O
the O
dynamics O
of O
the O
bovine O
spongiform O
encephalopathy O
( O
BSE B 
) O
, O
a O
fatal O
brain-wasting O

suffered O

was O
unlikely O

alter O
a O
slaughter O
plan O
agreed O
by O

its O
14 O
EU B

. O

" O
We O
agreed O
that O
following O

scientific O
analysis O
using O
a O
methodology O
which O
would O
take O
out O
the O
maximum O
number O
of O
BSE B 
cases O
possible O
. O

I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
very O
difficult O
to O
sell O
to O
the O
European B 
Commission I 
a O
programme O
which O
would O
involve O
the O
elimination O
of O
fewer O
BSE B 
cases O
, O
" O
Kiely B 
said O
. O

" O
We O
will O
look O
at O
our O
approach O
( O
to O
the O
plan O
) O
but O
we O
wo O
n't O
get O
involved O

the O
number O

be O

" O
he O
said O

" O
We O
have O
always O
avoided O

question O
of O
numbers O

to O
be O
slaughtered O
, O
that O
's O

The O
issue O
is O
the O
protection O
of O

' O
health O
and O
the O
rapid O
eradication O
of O
BSE B 
, O
" O
he O
added O
. O

The O
reaction O
is O
likely O
to O
disappoint O
British B 
farmers O
, O
who O
seized O
on O
research O
by O
Oxford B

journal O

it O
would O
be O
hard O

of O
the O
disease O
any O
faster O
than O
2001 O
without O
killing O
vast O
numbers O
of O
cattle O
. O

The O
researchers O
predicted O
there O
would O
be O
340 O
new O
infections O
and O
14,000 O
new O
cases O
of O
BSE B 
before O
2001 O
. O

British B 
farmers O
' O
leader O
called O
on O
Wednesday O
for O
an O
urgent O
meeting O
with O
ministers O
to O
discuss O
the O
report O
. O

" O
I O
hope O
the O
government O
will O
now O
make O
it O
clear O
they O
believe O
there O
is O
a O
better O
way O
of O
dealing O
with O
this O
issue O
, O
" O
National B 
Farmers I 
Union I 
president O
Sir O
David B 
Naish I 
told O
BBC B 
radio I 
. O

Naish B 
said O
there O
was O
no O
need O
for O
Britain B 
to O
carry O
out O
a O
planned O
cull O
of O
some O
147,000 O
cattle O
to O
which O
it O
had O
reluctantly O
agreed O
to O
placate O
its O
European B 
partners O
. O

" O
The O
new O
evidence O
to O
me O
means O
some O
of O
that O
proposal O
should O
be O
re-examined O
because O
we O
could O
get O
away O
with O
considerably O
less O
animals O
being O
culled O
if O
in O
fact O
scientists O
throughout O
Europe B 
accepted O
this O
evidence O
, O
" O
Naish B 
said O
. O

The O
report O
could O
well O
reopen O
a O
damaging O
row O
between O
Britain B

the O
EU B 
, O
which O
slapped O
a O
worldwide O

from O

In O
an O

following O
its O
first-half O
results O
, O
which O
included O
a O
less O
optimistic O
forecast O
for O
the O
second O
half O
of O
this O

it O
had O

in O

Sir O

action O
to O
protect O
it O

. O

Looking O
at O
market O
prospects O
, O
he O
said O
: O
" O
I O
think O
our O
best O
judgment O
at O
this O
stage O
is O
that O
it O
will O
probably O
bumble O
along O
in O
the O
rather O
mixed O
way O
it O
's O
been O
in O
the O
first O

" O

" O
It O
's O
very O
difficult O
to O
predict O
the O

( O

) O
this O

It O

be O

it O

" O

of O

sluggish O
first O
half O
and O
a O
rebound O
later O
in O
1996 O
, O
Hope B 
said O
: O
" O
I O
think O
the O
difference O
( O
now O
) O
is O
the O
first O
half O
has O
not O
actually O
been O
as O
bad O
as O
some O
felt O
it O
was O
going O
to O
be O
, O
but O
equally O
we O
're O
certainly O
not O
predicting O
a O
recovery O
in O
the O
second O
half O
. O
" O

Against O
this O
background O
, O
Hope B 
said O
the O
group O
was O
glad O
it O
had O
rationalised O
and O
destocked O
even O
though O
this O
had O
pressed O
margins O
, O
which O
had O
slipped O
to O
9.5 O
percent O
from O
11.3 O
percent O
a O
year O
ago O
. O

" O
I O
think O
the O
figure O
of O
9.5 O
percent O
on O
the O
first O
half O
, O
when O
you O
consider O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
've O
been O
destocking O
, O
the O
fairly O
mixed O
customer O
demand O
, O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
sold O
the O
( O
southern O
African B 
) O
mines O
actually O
is O
not O
bad O
. O

" O
It O
does O
show O
how O
easily O
we O
should O
be O
able O
to O
bounce O
back O
over O
10 O
percent O
again O
, O
" O
he O
added O
, O
saying O
: O
" O
We O
continue O
to O
feel O
very O
relaxed O
about O
our O
general O
view O
that O
we O
would O
average O
10 O
percent O
profit O
margins O
over O
the O
cycle O
. O
" O

" O
We O
've O
always O
taken O
the O
view O
that O
we O
are O
the O
sort O
of O
company O
that O
's O
quite O
capable O
of O
working O
in O
difficult O
circumstances O
-- O
we O

it O

And O
we O
feel O
very O
confident O
that O
we O
're O
doing O
all O
the O
right O
things O
, O
" O
Hope B 
said O
. O

" O
When O
the O
( O

figures O
will O
bounce O
back O
up O
again O
is O
just O
a O
function O

YORK I 

The O
outcome O
of O
the O
November O
elections O
emerged O
as O
a O
hot O
topic O
on O
Wall B 
Street I 
this O
week O
as O
financial O
pundits O
debated O
whether O
Robert B 
Rubin I 
might O
forgo O
a O
second O
term O
as O
Treasury B 
secretary O
if O
President O
Clinton B 
is O
re-elected O
. O

Concern O
centred O
on O
the O
currency O
markets O
since O
Rubin B 
's O
tour O
de O
force O
has O
been O
his O
unflagging O
support O
of O
the O
dollar O
. O

Speculation O
that O
Rubin B 
might O
not O
stay O
in O
his O
post O
grew O
after O
he O
sidestepped O
questions O
about O
any O
future O
Cabinet B 
post O
during O
television O
interviews O
at O
the O
Democratic B 
convention O
in O
Chicago B 
this O
week O
. O

Should O
Rubin B 
leave O
, O
Wall B 
Street I 
would O
worry O
that O
he O
might O
take O
his O
strong-dollar O
policy O
with O
him O
. O

Rubin B 
's O
predecessor O
at O
the O
Treasury B 
, O
Lloyd B 
Bentsen I 
, O
was O
viewed O
with O
suspicion O
by O
some O
in O
the O
financial O
markets O
who O
thought O
he O
had O
tried O
to O
push O
down O
the O
dollar O
to O
gain O
an O
edge O
in O
trade O
negotiations O
with O
Japan B 
. O

" O
Obviously O
, O
under O
the O
Clinton B 
administration O
, O
we O
've O
seen O
two O
distinctively O
different O
dollar O
policies O
, O
" O
said O
Chris B 
Widness I 
, O
an O
international O
economist O
at O
Chase B 
Securities I 
Inc. I 
" O
Under O
Rubin B 
, O
the O
U.S. B 
has O
certainly O
looked O
for O
a O
strong O
dollar O
. O
" O

That O
strategy O
, O
backed O
up O
by O
timely O
instances O
of O
joint O
central O
bank O
intervention O
, O
helped O
the O
dollar O
battle O
back O
from O
post-Second B 
World I 
War I 
lows O
of O
1.3438 O
German B 
marks O

Japanese B

on O
April O
19 O
, O
1995 O
. O

Currently O
, O
the O
dollar O
stands O
at O
about O
1.48 O
marks O
and O
109 O
yen O
. O

Rubin B 
was O
widely O
hailed O
as O
the O
architect O
of O
the O
dollar O
's O
comeback O
, O
using O
skills O
and O
expertise O
gained O
in O
26 O
years O
on O
Wall B 
Street I 
, O
part O
of O
which O
were O
spent O
as O
co-chairman O
of O
Goldman B 
, I 
Sachs I 
and I 
Co I 
. I 

Inc B 
. O

" O
Rubin B 
has O
done O
a O
fine O
job O
in O
that O
position O
, O
" O
said O
Michael B 
Faust I 
, O
a O
portfolio O
manager O
at O
Bailard B 
, I 
Biehl I 
and I 
Kaiser I 
, O
which O
manages O
just O
under O
$ O
1 O
billion O
in O
global O
stocks O
and O
bonds O
. O

" O
Anyone O
who O
would O
come O
in O
there O
to O
replace O
him O
would O
have O
awfully O
big O
shoes O
to O
fill O
. O
" O

Fear O
that O
a O
new O
Treasury B 
secretary O
might O
favour O
a O
return O
to O
Bentsen-era B 
policy O
could O
spell O
trouble O
for O
financial O
markets O
. O

Some O
overseas O
investors O
might O
shy O
away O
from O
buying O
U.S. B 
stocks O
and O
bonds O
or O
even O
sell O
them O
when O
the O
dollar O
is O
weakening O
. O

As O
for O
U.S. B 
Treasury I 
securities O
, O
Widness B 
explained O
that O
Alan B 
Greenspan I 
's O
reappointment O
as O
chairman O
of O
the O
Federal B 
Reserve I 
and O
the O
outlook O
for O
the O
federal O
budget O
were O
more O
important O
than O
whether O
Rubin B 
continues O
at O
the O
Treasury B 
. O

" O
Although O
, O
if O
we O
did O
get O
someone O
that O
was O
seen O
as O
looking O
for O
a O
dollar O
depreciation O
, O
it O
would O
probably O
hurt O
capital O
flows O
to O
the O
United B 
States I 
, O
" O
said O
Widness B 
, O
adding O
that O
could O
hurt O
U.S. B 
stocks O
and O
, O
to O
a O
lesser O
degree O
, O
bonds O
. O

Still O
, O
markets O
may O
have O
little O
to O
fear O
from O
any O
Rubin B 
successor O
because O
the O
firm O
dollar O
policy O
has O
yielded O
positive O
results O
. O

If O
that O
is O
true O
, O
then O
any O
new O
Treasury B 
chief O
would O
need O
to O
be O
as O
effective O
as O
Rubin B 
in O
convincing O
markets O
that O
the O
White B 
House I 
does O
indeed O
want O
a O
strong O
currency O
. O

" O
If O
he O
left O
, O
the O
first O
question O
people O
would O
ask O
the O
next O
guy O
is O
, O
' O
What O
's O
your O
view O
on O
the O
dollar O
? O
' O

" O
said O
Michael B 
Perelstein I 
, O
portfolio O
manager O
of O
MainStay B 
International I 
Funds I 
. O

" O
And O
all O
I O
can O
say O
as O
a O
piece O
of O
advice O
is O
that O
they O
'd O
better O
say O
exactly O
the O
same O
thing O
( O
as O
Rubin B 
) O
, O
if O
not O
stronger O
, O
" O
Perelstein B

. O
" O

Otherwise O
, O
you O
get O
