The O
European B 
Commission I 
said O
on O
Thursday O
it O
disagreed O
with O
German B 
advice O
to O
consumers O
to O
shun O
British B 
lamb O
until O
scientists O
determine O
whether O
mad O
cow O

can O
be O
transmitted O
to O

. O

Germany B 
's O
representative O
to O
the O
European B 
Union I 
's O
veterinary O
committee O
Werner B 
Zwingmann I 
said O
on O
Wednesday O
consumers O
should O
buy O
sheepmeat O
from O
countries O
other O
than O
Britain B 
until O
the O
scientific O
advice O
was O
clearer O
. O

" O
We O
do O
n't O
support O
any O
such O
recommendation O
because O
we O
do O
n't O
see O
any O
grounds O
for O
it O
, O
" O
the O
Commission B 
's O
chief O
spokesman O
Nikolaus B 
van I 
der I 
Pas I 
told O
a O
news O
briefing O
. O

He O
said O
further O
scientific O
study O
was O
required O
and O
if O
it O
was O
found O
that O
action O
was O
needed O
it O
should O
be O
taken O
by O
the O
European B 
Union I 
. O

He O
said O
a O
proposal O
last O
month O
by O
EU B 
Farm O
Commissioner O
Franz B 
Fischler I 
to O
ban O
sheep O
brains O
, O
spleens O
and O
spinal O
cords O
from O
the O
human O
and O
animal O
food O
chains O
was O
a O
highly O
specific O
and O
precautionary O
move O
to O
protect O
human O
health O
. O

Fischler B 
proposed O
EU-wide B 
measures O
after O
reports O
from O
Britain B 
and O
France B 
that O
under O
laboratory O
conditions O
sheep O
could O
contract O
Bovine B 
Spongiform I 
Encephalopathy I 
( O
BSE B 
) O
-- O
mad O
cow O
disease O
. O

But O
Fischler B 
agreed O
to O
review O
his O
proposal O
after O
the O
EU B 
's O
standing O
veterinary O
committee O
, O
mational O
animal O
health O
officials O
, O
questioned O
if O
such O
action O
was O
justified O
as O
there O
was O
only O
a O
slight O
risk O
to O
human O
health O
. O

Spanish B 
Farm O
Minister O
Loyola B 
de I

had O
earlier O
accused O
Fischler B 
at O
an O
EU B 
farm O
ministers O
' O
meeting O
of O
causing O
unjustified O
alarm O
through O
" O
dangerous O
generalisation O
. O
" O

. O

Only O
France B 
and O
Britain B 
backed O
Fischler B 
's O
proposal O
. O

The O
EU B 
's O
scientific O
veterinary O
and O
multidisciplinary O
committees O
are O
due O
to O
re-examine O
the O
issue O
early O
next O

and O
make O
recommendations O
to O
the O
senior O
veterinary O
officials O
. O

Sheep O
have O
long O
been O
known O
to O
contract O
scrapie O
, O
a O
brain-wasting O
disease O
similar O
to O
BSE B 
which O
is O
believed O
to O
have O
been O
transferred O
to O

through O

animal O

. O

British B 
farmers O
denied O
on O
Thursday O
there O
was O
any O
danger O
to O
human O
health O
from O
their O
sheep O
, O
but O
expressed O
concern O
that O
German B 
government O
advice O
to O
consumers O
to O
avoid O
British B 
lamb O
might O
influence O
consumers O

illness O
by O

contaminated O
beef O
. O

The O
European B 
Commission I 
agreed O
this O
month O
to O
rethink O
a O
proposal O
to O
ban O
the O
use O
of O
suspect O
sheep O
tissue O
after O
some O
EU B 
veterinary O
experts O
questioned O
whether O
it O

EU B 
Farm O
Commissioner O

banning O
sheep O
brains O
, O
spleens O

spinal O

Bovine B

But O
some O

the O

questioned O
whether O
the O
action O
was O
necessary O
given O
the O
slight O

human O
health O
. O

The O
question O
is O
being O
studied O

two O
EU B

. O

British B 
officials O
say O
sheep O
meat O
is O
perfectly O
safe O
to O

. O

ZDF B

Germany B
