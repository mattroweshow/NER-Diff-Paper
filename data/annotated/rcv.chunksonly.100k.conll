The O
European B 
Commission I 
said O
on O
Thursday O
it O
disagreed O
with O
German B 
advice O
to O
consumers O
to O
shun O
British B 
lamb O
until O
scientists O
determine O
whether O
mad O
cow O

can O
be O
transmitted O
to O

. O

Germany B 
's O
representative O
to O
the O
European B 
Union I 
's O
veterinary O
committee O
Werner B 
Zwingmann I 
said O
on O
Wednesday O
consumers O
should O
buy O
sheepmeat O
from O
countries O
other O
than O
Britain B 
until O
the O
scientific O
advice O
was O
clearer O
. O

" O
We O
do O
n't O
support O
any O
such O
recommendation O
because O
we O
do O
n't O
see O
any O
grounds O
for O
it O
, O
" O
the O
Commission B 
's O
chief O
spokesman O
Nikolaus B 
van I 
der I 
Pas I 
told O
a O
news O
briefing O
. O

He O
said O
further O
scientific O
study O
was O
required O
and O
if O
it O
was O
found O
that O
action O
was O
needed O
it O
should O
be O
taken O
by O
the O
European B 
Union I 
. O

He O
said O
a O
proposal O
last O
month O
by O
EU B 
Farm O
Commissioner O
Franz B 
Fischler I 
to O
ban O
sheep O
brains O
, O
spleens O
and O
spinal O
cords O
from O
the O
human O
and O
animal O
food O
chains O
was O
a O
highly O
specific O
and O
precautionary O
move O
to O
protect O
human O
health O
. O

Fischler B 
proposed O
EU-wide B 
measures O
after O
reports O
from O
Britain B 
and O
France B 
that O
under O
laboratory O
conditions O
sheep O
could O
contract O
Bovine B 
Spongiform I 
Encephalopathy I 
( O
BSE B 
) O
-- O
mad O
cow O
disease O
. O

But O
Fischler B 
agreed O
to O
review O
his O
proposal O
after O
the O
EU B 
's O
standing O
veterinary O
committee O
, O
mational O
animal O
health O
officials O
, O
questioned O
if O
such O
action O
was O
justified O
as O
there O
was O
only O
a O
slight O
risk O
to O
human O
health O
. O

Spanish B 
Farm O
Minister O
Loyola B 
de I

had O
earlier O
accused O
Fischler B 
at O
an O
EU B 
farm O
ministers O
' O
meeting O
of O
causing O
unjustified O
alarm O
through O
" O
dangerous O
generalisation O
. O
" O

. O

Only O
France B 
and O
Britain B 
backed O
Fischler B 
's O
proposal O
. O

The O
EU B 
's O
scientific O
veterinary O
and O
multidisciplinary O
committees O
are O
due O
to O
re-examine O
the O
issue O
early O
next O

and O
make O
recommendations O
to O
the O
senior O
veterinary O
officials O
. O

Sheep O
have O
long O
been O
known O
to O
contract O
scrapie O
, O
a O
brain-wasting O
disease O
similar O

BSE B 
which O
is O
believed O
to O
have O
been O
transferred O
to O

animal O

. O

British B 
farmers O
denied O
on O
Thursday O
there O
was O
any O
danger O
to O
human O
health O
from O
their O
sheep O
, O
but O
expressed O
concern O
that O
German B 
government O
advice O
to O
consumers O
to O
avoid O
British B 
lamb O
might O
influence O

illness O

contaminated O
beef O
. O

The O
European B 
Commission I 
agreed O
this O
month O
to O
rethink O
a O
proposal O
to O
ban O
the O
use O
of O
suspect O
sheep O
tissue O
after O
some O
EU B 
veterinary O
experts O
questioned O
whether O
it O

EU B 
Farm O

banning O
sheep O
brains O
, O
spleens O

spinal O

But O
some O

questioned O
whether O
the O
action O
was O
necessary O
given O
the O
slight O

human O
health O

The O
question O
is O
being O
studied O

. O

British B 
officials O
say O
sheep O
meat O
is O
perfectly O
safe O
to O

. O

ZDF B

Germany B

Lauck B

argued O
that O

title O
of O

During O
the O

The O

rejected O

that O
Lauck B

extradition O
from O

where O
he O
was O
arrested O
in O
March O

He O
will O
probably O
be O
free O
in O
around O
two O
and O
a O
half O
years O

The O

ruled O
that O
the O
15 O
months O

has O
spent O
in O
custody O

, O
with O
nothing O

said O
the O
cost O
of O
such O
unimported O
goods O
was O
$ O
1.10 O
billion O
in O
1995 O
. O

Barter O
deals O
were O
worth O
$ O
4.9 O

last O

, O
or O
about O
eight O

all O

at O

, O
she O
said O
. O

" O
The O
cost O
of O
exported O
goods O
is O
too O
often O
understated O
, O
so O
the O

share O
of O

in O

and O
the O
amount O
of O
unimported O

may O
be O
even O
higher O
, O
" O
Volkova B 
said O
. O

A O
few O
days O
ago O
Russian B 
President O
Boris B 
Yeltsin I 
issued O
a O
decree O
on O
state O
regulation O
of O
foreign O
barter O

, O
and O
Volkova B 
said O
this O
" O
could O
substantially O
improve O
the O

" O
. O

In O
line O
with O
the O
decree O
, O
which O
will O
come O
into O
force O
on O
November O
1 O
, O
all O
Russian B

will O
be O
obliged O
to O
import O
goods O
worth O
the O
cost O
of O
their O

180 O
days O
. O

" O
If O

are O
late O
, O
they O
will O
have O
to O
pay O

, O
" O
Volkova B

Understating O
the O

of O

could O
still O
be O
a O
loophole O
for O

, O
but O
Volkova B

the O
authorities O
are O
currently O
" O

Barter O
has O
always O

, O
but O
Yeltsin B 
's O
decrees O
liberalising O
foreign O
trade O
in O
1991-1992 O
has O
given O
barter O
a O
new O
impetus O
. O

A O
few O
years O
ago O
, O
barter O
deals O
accounted O
for O
up O
to O
25-30 O
percent O
of O
Russian B

because O
" O

" O
, O
Volkova B

" O
Now O

Mutola B 
pushed O
Masterkova B 
all O
the O
way O
, O
finishing O
second O
in O
2:29.66 O
. O

But O
it O
was O
the O
Russian B 
who O
picked O
up O
the O
bonus O
of O
$ O
25,000 O
for O
the O
historic O
run O
in O
front O
of O
a O

her O
return O

In O
her O
first O

at O
the O
richest O
meeting O
in O
Zurich B 
last O
Wednesday O
, O
she O
slashed O

. O

The O

50,000 O
plus O
one O
kilo O
of O
gold O
. O

After O
Friday O

the O
Russian B 
will O
have O
earned O
well O
over O
$ O
100,000 O
in O
less O
than O
a O

, O
taking O
her O

Brussels B

laid O
a O
new O

the O

comparable O
to O
the O

at O
the O
Atlanta B

but O
put O
down O
on O
a O
softer O

. O

Masterkova B 
clearly O
enjoyed O
it O
. O

Mutola B 
looked O
threatening O
in O
the O
final O
200 O
metres O
but O
the O
Russian B 
found O
an O
extra O

Many O

apparently O
saw O
their O
crucial O

last O

because O

were O
jammed O
with O
blue-and-white O

To O
be O
sure O
, O
sales O
of O
Windows B

the O
accompanying O

drove O
Microsoft B 
sales O
up O
46 O
percent O
last O
year O
to O
a O
record O
$ O
8.67 O
billion O
and O
cemented O
the O

Microsoft B 
executives O
say O
they O
are O
thrilled O
with O
the O

that O

the O

now O
used O
on O

But O
Enderle B 
said O
the O
figure O
could O
have O
been O
even O
higher O
if O
Microsoft B 
had O
done O
a O
better O
job O

handling O
the O
huge O

He O
and O
other O

said O
corporate O
America B

" O
Microsoft B

that O

going O

the O
answer O
, O
" O
Winkler B

" O

Many O

began O
to O

now O
that O

Winkler B

only O

Up O
to O
100,000 O
tonnes O
of O
copper O
held O
in O
Shanghai B 
bonded O
warehouses O
, O
confounding O
the O
world O
market O
as O
to O
its O
source O
and O
ultimate O
fate O
, O
probably O
belongs O
to O
China B 
's O
strategic O
state O
reserve O
, O
industry O
sources O
said O
on O
Friday O
. O

Around O
40,000 O
tonnes O
of O
the O
copper O
have O
already O
been O
moved O
to O
warehouses O
near O
the O
northern O
port O
of O
Yingkou B 
, O
where O
some O
of O
the O
strategic O
stockpile O
was O
stored O
, O
they O
said O
. O

Just O
who O
owns O
the O
copper O
is O
a O
question O
that O
has O
kept O
traders O
and O
industry O
analysts O
guessing O
since O
the O
metal O
was O
channelled O
into O
Shanghai B 
by O
the O
China B 
National I 
Nonferrous I 
Metals I 
Import I 
and I 
Export I 
Corp I 
( O
CNIEC B 
) O
in O
June O
and O
July O
. O

It O
was O
unclear O
whether O
or O
not O
the O
40,000 O
tonnes O
had O
cleared O
customs O
-- O
which O
would O
provide O
some O
concrete O
indication O
that O
the O
strategic O
reserve O
, O
administered O
directly O
by O
the O
central O
government O
's O
State B 
Planning I 
Commission I 
, O
owned O
the O
copper O
. O

Traders O
have O
said O
the O
reserve O
could O
negotiate O
concessions O
on O
duties O
-- O
three O
percent O
import O
tax O
and O
17 O
percent O
value-added O
tax O
-- O
that O
made O
the O
copper O
prohibitively O
expensive O
otherwise O
. O

But O
one O
source O
, O
the O
head O
of O
a O
Hong B 
Kong I 
trading O
house O
, O
said O
it O
made O
no O
difference O
if O
the O
copper O
was O
customs O
cleared O
or O
not O
. O

" O
If O
they O
spend O
all O
this O
money O
moving O
the O
copper O
to O
Yingkou B 
, O
it O
will O
be O
sitting O
there O
for O
years O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

" O
Once O
it O
arrives O
in O
Yingkou B 
, O
it O
is O
subject O
to O
monitoring O
by O
the O
State B 
Planning I 
Commission I 
, O
which O
has O
to O
give O
permission O
for O
any O
more O
movement O
; O
it O
is O
out O
of O
the O
hands O
of O
traders O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

Mystery O
has O
surrounded O
the O
Shanghai B 
stockpile O
in O
recent O
months O
, O
with O
traders O
unsure O
not O
only O
of O
who O
owns O
it O
, O
but O
of O
its O
exact O
size O
and O
what O
its O
owner O
planned O
to O
do O
with O
it O
. O

Trading O
sources O
generally O
agreed O
it O
would O
be O
cost-effective O
to O
take O
the O
copper O
back O
into O
a O
depleted O
central O
reserve O
as O
it O
had O
already O
served O
its O
purpose O
in O
taking O
advantage O
of O
long-term O
backwardation O
on O
the O
London B 
Metal I 
Exchange I 
( O
LME B 
) O
. O

A O
backwardation O
occurs O
when O
the O
spot O
price O
of O
a O
metal O
is O
higher O
than O
the O
forward O
price O
. O

CNIEC B 
lent O
around O
85,000 O
tonnes O
of O
copper O
onto O
the O
LME B 
between O
April O
and O
June O
1995 O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
state O
reserve O
, O
running O
the O
state O
stockpile O
down O
to O
115,000 O
tonnes O
from O
200,000 O
tonnes O
previously O
. O

Traders O
in O
Asia B 
said O
CNIEC B 
could O
well O
have O
lent O
it O
to O
the O
market O
at O
around O
US$ B 
2,700 O
a O
tonne O
, O
and O
then O
paid O
somewhere O
between O
$ O
2,200 O
and O
$ O
2,400 O
a O
tonne O
when O
it O
started O
taking O
the O
metal O
back O
earlier O
this O
year O
. O

This O
would O
have O
cleared O
CNIEC B 
a O
healthy O
profit O
, O
which O
could O
then O
have O
been O
used O
to O
finance O
storage O
and O
other O
costs O
. O

Word O
that O
CNIEC B 
had O
offered O
the O
copper O
to O
European B 
trading O
houses O
in O
a O
series O
of O
secret O
meetings O
unnerved O
an O
already O
jittery O
market O
. O

on O
Wednesday O
the O
motivation O
of O
the O
owners O
of O
the O
85,000 O
tonnes O
, O
" O

they O
are O
, O
is O
the O
most O
important O
short-term O

" O

BME B 
repeated O
in O

rumours O
of O
involvement O
by O
Sumitomo B

, O
with O
CNIEC B

in O
June O
losses O
of O
$ O
1.8 O
billion O
in O
a O
decade O
of O
unauthorised O

. O

Sumitomo B 
and O
CNIEC B 
have O
made O
no O
comments O
on O
the O
talk O
and O
Chinese B 
traders O
said O
they O
know O
nothing O
of O
such O
an O
arrangement O
. O

Traders O
in O
Shanghai B 
said O
on O
Thursday O
they O
were O
unaware O
of O
movements O
out O
of O
the O
Shanghai B 
bonded O
warehouses O
. O

They O
reported O
more O
arrivals O
that O
were O
probably O
spot O
purchases O
. O

They O
also O
expressed O
concern O
that O
the O
tonnage O
in O
bonded O
warehouses O
would O
move O
onto O
the O
domestic O
market O
. O

But O
these O
concerns O
were O
irrelevant O
, O
a O
Singapore B 
trader O
said O
, O
despite O
a O
forecast O
that O
domestic O
Chinese B 
copper O
demand O
could O
hit O
one O
million O
tonnes O
this O
year O
. O

As O
with O
many O
commodities O
, O
" O
there O
is O
a O
desire O
( O
by O
the O
Chinese B 
government O
) O
to O
keep O
a O
stockpile O
of O
the O
metal O
, O
" O

They O
show O
that O

aware O

building O
cells O
in O
some O
of O
his O

or O
was O

house O
where O
Julie B

to O
just O
take O
the O

Chris B 
Lewis I 
did O
his O
best O
to O
forget O
his O
controversial O
omission O
from O
the O
England B 
one-day O
squad O
on O
Sunday O
but O
could O
not O
prevent O
Pakistan B 
reasserting O
their O
dominance O
in O
the O
final O
test O
at O
The B 
Oval I 
. O

A O
super O
piece O

fielding O
by O
Lewis B 
, O
dropped O
as O
a O
disciplinary O
measure O
after O
arriving O
only O
35 O
minutes O
before O
the O
start O
on O
the O
fourth O
morning O
, O
provided O
the O
only O
bright O
spot O
for O
England B 
as O
the O
touring O
team O
batted O
on O
to O
reach O
413 O
for O
five O
at O
the O
interval O
, O
a O
lead O
of O
87 O
. O

The O
solitary O
wicket O
to O
fall O
was O
Asif B 
Mujtaba I 
, O
run O
out O
for O
13 O
attempting O
a O
second O
run O
to O
third O
man O
where O
Lewis B 
was O
lurking O
with O
a O
point O
to O
prove O
. O

There O
seemed O
scant O
danger O
until O
the O
Surrey B 
player O
swooped O
on O
to O
the O
ball O
and O
returned O
off O
balance O
to O
county O
team O
mate O
Alec B 
Stewart I 
who O
whipped O
off O
the O
bails O

Lewis B 
, O
though O
, O
could O
not O
make O
similar O
waves O
with O
the O
ball O
as O
Salim B 
Malik I 
and O
Wasim B 
Akram I 
batted O
through O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
session O
with O
few O
alarms O

Wasim B 
rattled O
along O
to O
30 O
not O
out O
, O
outscoring O
his O
partner O
who O
was O
unbeaten O
on O
24 O
at O
the O
break O
, O
although O
the O
weather O
was O
again O
threatening O

Rain O
arrived O
just O
as O
the O
players O
left O
the O
field O
for O
lunch O
, O
forcing O
the O
ground-staff O
into O
action O

The O

Zinzan B 
Brooke I 
, O
the O
only O
No O
8 O
in O
test O
rugby O
to O
have O
scored O
a O
dropped O
goal O
when O
he O
kicked O
a O
three-pointer O
against O
England B 
during O
last O
year O
's O
World B 
Cup I 
, O
added O
a O
second O
to O
his O
name O
yesterday O
. O

I O
was O
right O
here O
, O
' O
' O
he O
said O
standing O
at O
the O
spot O
where O
he O
had O
received O
the O
ball O
for O
the O
kick O
. O

The O
maul O
was O
there O
and O
I O
was O
going O
to O
go O
in O
but O
I O
thought O
I O
should O
hold O
off O
because O
we O
had O
the O
ball O
. O

When O
( O
halfback O
) O
Justin B 
Marshall I 
got O
the O
ball O
he O
was O
going O
to O
go O
on O
the O
openside O
where O
Jon B 
Preston I 
was O
so O
I O
emptied O
my O
lung O
at O
him O
to O
get O
the O
ball O
this O
way O
. O

I O
just O
hit O
through O
and O
I O
was O
punching O
the O
air O
before O
the O
ball O
got O
there O
. O

It O
cost O
me O
a O
few O
bucks O
at O
the O
bar O
. O
' O

' O

The O
decision O
to O
attempt O
a O
dropped O
goal O
was O
a O
spontaneous O
one O
, O
Brooke B 
said O
. O

It O
was O
just O
like O
the O
World B 
Cup I 
, O
the O
ball O
came O
and O
the O
chance O
was O
there O
. O

Centre O
Frank B 
Bunce I 
said O
he O
had O
never O
felt O
so O
exhausted O
during O
a O
match O
. O

We O
were O
gutted O
and O
there O
was O
nowhere O
to O
hide O
, O
they O
just O
kept O
coming O
at O
you O
, O
' O
' O
he O
said O
. O

I O
was O
gone O
in O
the O
first O
20 O
minutes O
, O
completely O
exhausted O
, O
but O
you O
had O
no O
choice O
. O

There O
was O
just O
so O
much O
riding O
on O
it O
. O

It O
's O
amazing O
just O
how O
big O
this O
ground O
was O
yesterday O
. O

' O

Two-try O
winger O
Jeff B 
Wilson I 
said O
he O
was O
so O
tired O
that O
he O
kept O
asking O
Bunce B 
where O
he O
should O
be O
while O
defending O
. O

He O
told O
me O
I O
'm O
buggered O
too O
so O
just O
hang O
in O
there O
' O
, O
' O

who O
have O
the O

of O

on O
their O
hands O

Leaders O
of O
the O
major O
parties O

from O

to O

, O
appeared O
before O
Archbishop O

Reconciliation I 
Commission I 
last O

to O
paint O
the O
broad O

of O
their O
actions O

against O

Most O

former O

Klerk I 
and O
African B 
National I 
Congress I 
Deputy O
President O
Thabo B

offered O

mistakes O
they O
had O
made O
and O
accepted O
broad O
responsibility O
for O
the O
actions O
of O
their O

But O
none O

those O
guilty O

or O
carrying O
out O
any O
of O
the O
gross O
violations O
of O
human O
rights O
which O
Tutu B 
is O
investigating O
. O

Human O
rights O
lawyer O
Brian B 
Currin I 
said O
the O
hearings O
last O
week O
were O
not O
intended O
as O
a O
form O
of O
confessional O
and O
that O
those O
who O
personally O
committed O
crimes O
during O
apartheid O
would O
testify O
only O
before O
a O
separate O
arm O
of O
the O
commission O
, O
the O
amnesty O
committee O
. O

" O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
one O
should O
have O
expected O
more O
than O
what O
one O
got O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O
" O

That O
was O
not O
the O
amnesty O
committee O
where O
perpetrators O
are O
expected O
to O
open O
their O
hearts O
and O
souls O
and O
to O
tell O
it O
all O
. O
" O

The O
commission O
, O
which O
has O
the O
power O
to O
grant O
amnesty O
to O
those O
who O
confess O
to O
abuses O
, O
has O
begun O
hearing O
the O
testimony O
from O
people O
already O
in O
jail O
for O
their O
deeds O
. O

But O
others O
, O
such O
as O
self-confessed O
secret O
police O
hit-squad O
leader O
Dirk B 
Coetzee I 
, O
have O
yet O
to O
testify O
. O

Tutu B 
's O
deputy O
chairman O
, O
Alex B 
Boraine I 
, O
told O
reporters O
the O
commission O
would O
begin O
issuing O
subpoenas O
to O
suspects O
who O
refused O
to O
appear O
voluntarily O
some O
time O
this O
week O
. O

He O
added O
that O
former O
hardline O
apartheid O
president O
P.W. B 
Botha I 
could O
be O
among O
those O
called O
. O

But O
Currin B 
, O
who O
is O
advising O
several O
people O
regarded O
as O
perpetrators O
, O
said O
this O
was O
not O
the O
best O
way O
to O
achieve O
the O
commission O
's O
aims O
. O

" O
A O
person O
can O
be O
forced O
to O
appear O
, O
but O
the O
only O
way O
one O
is O
going O
to O
get O
to O
the O
truth O
in O
its O
totality O
is O
if O
people O
feel O
it O
is O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
go O
to O
the O
amnesty O
committee O
. O

At O
the O
moment O
this O
is O
not O
the O
case O
. O
" O

He O
cited O
Coetzee B 
, O
who O
was O
charged O
with O
murder O
after O
confessing O
in O
media O
interviews O
to O
dirty O
tricks O
. O

His O
trial O
is O
due O
to O
start O
in O
December O
but O
the O
truth O
commission O
intends O
to O
decide O
on O
his O
amnesty O
application O
before O
that O
. O

Currin B 
said O
the O
law O
had O
to O
be O
changed O
so O
all O
judicial O
prosecutions O
were O
automatically O
suspended O
for O
those O
who O
approached O
the O
truth O
commission O

Last O

submissions O

ANC B

National B 
Party I 
and O
the O
right-wing O
Freedom B 
Front I 
of O
General O
Constand B 
Viljoen I 
left O
many O
South B 
Africans I 
unsatisfied O
. O

Boraine B 
said O
the O
picture O
was O
incomplete O
because O
officers O
of O
the O
apartheid-era O
security O
forces O
had O
yet O
to O
make O
their O
scheduled O
, O
separate O
submission O
, O
but O
one O
black O
caller O
to O
a O
radio O
talk O
show O
declared O
: O

" O
This O
whole O
thing O
is O
utterly O
useless O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
help O
us O
at O
all O
. O

What O
the O
people O
expect O
is O
to O
have O
houses O
, O
to O
have O
jobs O
. O
" O

Political O
scientist O
Jannie B 
Gagiano I 
said O
he O
doubted O
that O
the O
National B 
Party I 
, O
which O
implemented O
apartheid O
in O
1948 O
and O
began O
dismantling O
it O
in O
1990 O
, O
felt O
it O
carried O
a O
burden O
of O
guilt O
and O
needed O
to O
be O
exculpated O
through O
the O
commission O
. O

" O
Therefore O
I O
have O
some O
doubts O
about O
achieving O
some O
form O
of O
reconciliation O
. O

One O
has O
to O
feel O
a O
bit O
guilty O
to O
feel O
the O
need O
for O
reconciling O
yourself O
to O
a O
historical O
adversary O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

Professor O
Tom B 
Lodge I 
of O
the O
University B 
of I 
the I 
Witwatersrand I 
demurred O
, O
saying O
: O

" O
In O
the O
irritation O
, O
in O
the O
jokes O
, O
in O
the O
anger O
that O
white O
South B 
Africans I 
express O
about O
the O
commission O
, O
I O
think O
there O
's O
a O
moral O
uneasiness O

I O
think O
that O

What O
it O

this O
: O
If O

" O
Happily O
the O

" O

We O

of O

. O

The O
most O
obvious O
one O
with O
the O
greatest O
effect O
on O
the O
corporation O
was O
at O
Impala B 
where O
we O
had O
the O

, O
" O
Gilbertson B

. O

Implats B 
posted O
year O
attributable O
profit O
of O
176 O
million O
rand O
from O
281 O

Not O
only O
did O
the O

lock O
in O

in O
February O
/ O
March O
, O
but O
it O
suffered O

due O
to O
a O

last O
August O
. O

The O
rand O
was O
last O

at O

against O

Nor O
was O
Implats B 
the O
only O
operation O
to O

. O

Ingwe B 
Coal I

It O

one O

at O

in O
Mpumulanga B 
province O
. O

But O
Gilbertson B 
said O
the O
greatest O
gloom O
in O
the O
year O
came O
from O
the O
European B 
Commission I 
's O
blocking O
of O
Implats B 
' O
proposed O

with O
Lonrho B

's O

. O

" O
The O
big O
disappointment O
for O
the O
year O
was O
the O
failure O
of O
the O
platinum O
merger O
. O

From O
Gencor B 
's O
perspective O
we O
are O
taking O
the O
position O
that O
it O
is O
not O
on O
, O
" O
Gilbertson B 
said O
. O

Looking O
ahead O
to O
the O
current O
financial O
year O
, O
he O
said O
that O
Gencor B 
would O
boost O
earnings O
further O
. O

" O
Gencor B 
is O
well O
placed O
to O
take O
up O
the O
challenges O
of O
the O
future O
. O

The O
group O
is O
soundly O
structured O
and O
prudently O
financed O
and O
is O
blessed O
with O
an O
excellent O
portfolio O
of O
world-class O
businesses O
. O

I O
think O
we O
can O
look O
forward O
to O
further O
growth O
" O
. O

Citing O
the O

of O
Gencor B

Malbak B 
Ltd I 
for O
one O

, O
Gilbertson B 
said O
Gencor B 
had O
pruned O
its O
portfolio O
to O
concentrate O
on O
core O
assets O
. O

" O
We O
've O
tried O
to O
clean O
up O
our O
overall O
portfolio O
by O
disposing O
of O
non-core O
assets O
. O

The O
biggest O
of O
those O
was O
Malbak B

Overall O
a O
very O
substantial O
pruning O

leaving O
Gencor B 
clearly O
structured O
along O

lines O
, O
" O
Gilbertson B 
said O
. O

He O
added O
that O
the O
group O
still O
had O
about O
85 O
million O
rand O
after O
tax O
invested O
in O
various O
shares O
, O
which O
were O
market O
for O

when O
required O
. O

Referring O
to O
Gencor B 
's O
increased O
41.5 O
percent O
stake O
in O
Ingwe B 
, O
Gilbertson B 
said O
the O
group O
would O
wait O
for O
coal O
shares O
to O
be O
cheaper O
before O
considering O
snapping O
up O
more O
. O

" O
I O
think O
we O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
have O
more O
of O
Ingwe B 
but O
it O
's O
the O
question O
of O
adding O
value O
. O

When O
we O
bought O
the O
shares O
we O
bought O
... O

at O
quite O
a O
bit O
lower O
than O
the O
price O
is O
now O
... O

maybe O
if O
we O
just O
wait O
another O
few O
years O
for O
the O
next O
downturn O
in O
coal O
. O
" O

Finally O
, O
Gilbertson B

a O

The O
tiny O
islands O
of O
the O
Seychelles B 
failed O
to O
make O
soccer O
history O
at O
the O
weekend O
when O
they O
bowed O
out O

the O
preliminary O

of O
the O
African B 
Nations I

The O
Seychelles B 
must O
have O
thought O
they O

on O

for O
a O
historic O
breakthrough O
when O
Mauritian B 
midfielder O
Andre B 
Caboche I

sent O
off O
for O
a O
crude O
tackle O
in O
the O

immediately O
-- O

Ashley B 
Mocude I

give O
them O
a O
two-goal O
aggregate O

. O

Although O
Danny B 
Rose I

gave O
the O
Seychellois B

hope O
they O
could O
not O

net O
again O
and O

said O
he O
felt O
the O
players O
ought O
to O
have O
organised O
an O
active O
protest O
. O

" O
I O
feel O
that O
we O
made O
it O
a O
little O
easy O
for O
the O
USTA B 
. O

They O
did O
n't O
really O
get O
hurt O
as O
much O
as O
I O
think O
they O
should O
have O
, O
" O
said O
Stich B 
. O
" O

I O
feel O
that O
we O
should O
have O
maybe O
just O
cancelled O
out O
the O
Monday O
, O
not O
show O
up O
today O
and O
start O
the O
tournament O
tomorrow O
. O
" O

But O
once O
the O
27-year-old O
Stich B 
got O
on O
the O
court O
, O
he O
focused O
his O
energies O
on O
trying O
to O
win O
the O
year O
's O
last O
Grand B 
Slam I 
. O

He O
took O
a O
positive O
first O
step O
with O
his O
6-3 O
1-6 O
6-1 O
7-5 O
win O
over O
compatriot O
Haas B 
on O
a O
sun-baked O
Grandstand B 
court O
. O

Others O
advancing O
early O
on O
Monday O
included O
11th-seeded O
American B 
Malivai I 
Washington I 
, O
the O
Wimbledon B 
runner-up O
, O
Sweden B 
's O
Magnus B 
Gustafsson I 
, O
and O
two-time O
former O
French B 
Open I 
champion O
Sergi B 
Bruguera I 
of O
Spain B 
, O
who O
will O
be O
Stich B 
's O
next O
opponent O
. O

The O
suspicion O
, O
however O
, O
lingers O
in O
Stich B 
's O
mind O
that O
U.S. B 
Open I 
officials O
did O
tamper O
with O
the O
seeding O
process O
in O
order O
to O
benefit O
homegrown O
players O
. O

" O
I O
get O
the O
feeling O
that O
everything O
is O
done O
here O
for O
the O
American B 
players O
and O
they O
forget O
about O
all O
the O
other O
players O
, O
" O
said O
Stich B 
, O
who O
lost O
the O
1994 O
Open B 
final O
to O
Andre B 
Agassi I 
. O

It O
was O
Agassi B 
who O
was O
at O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
controversy O
that O
engulfed O
the O
tournament O
since O
the O
original O
draw O
was O
completed O
on O
Wednesday O
. O

The O
flamboyant O
American B 
star O
was O
bumped O
up O
two O
spots O
from O
his O
ATP B 
ranking O
of O
eight O
to O
a O
seeding O
of O
six O
. O

" O
He O
( O
Agassi B 
) O
should O
be O
seeded O
the O
way O
he O
is O
playing O
tennis O
right O
now O
, O
" O
said O
Stich B 
about O
the O
unfairness O
of O
moving O
up O
Agassi B 
, O
who O
made O
early O
exits O
from O
the O
French B 
Open I 
and O
Wimbledon B 
. O

Stich B 
, O
not O
seeded O
here O
for O
the O
first O
time O
since O
1990 O
, O
might O
have O
benefitted O
from O
some O
fiddling O
with O
the O
seedings O
himself O
after O
Kafelnikov B 
withdrew O
. O

Ranked O
18th O
in O
the O
world O
, O
Stich B 
might O
have O
been O
slipped O
into O
that O
spot O
ahead O
of O
Spain B 
's O
Felix B 
Mantilla I 
, O
who O
is O
16th O
but O
had O
never O
been O
played O
in O
the O
Open B 
and O
had O
been O
left O
out O
of O
the O
seedings O
originally O
. O

But O
Stich B 
did O
n't O
want O
to O
play O
that O
game O
. O

" O
I O
think O
he O
deserves O
to O
be O
seeded O
as O
everybody O
else O
who O
is O
in O
the O
top O
16 O
deserves O
to O
be O
seeded O
, O
